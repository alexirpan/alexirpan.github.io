One of my main hobbies is puzzlehunts. They're a little hard to describe,
but generally, a puzzlehunt puzzle is some given data that usually
doesn't come with direct instructions. Figuring out what to do is part of the
puzzle, and it will usually be obvious when you are doing the right thing.
Puzzles come in all sorts of forms, but will always result in an answer, which is
usually an English word or phrase. See [this post](https://blog.vero.site/post/puzzlehunts)
for a more detailed introduction.

I have been solving puzzlehunts since 2010, and have written some puzzles too.
My more recent puzzles are better than my old ones, but I'm including everything for
completeness.
