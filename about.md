*Last updated June 11, 2022.*

I currently work as a Software
Engineer on the Robotics @ Google team, which is part of Google Brain. The views expressed on this blog are
personal opinions, and do not reflect the opinions of my employer.

My main research interest is deep reinforcement learning and imitation learning, as
applied to robotics.
In general, I like thinking about what's necessary to make robot learning work
for real-world problems. Much of my work has been based on how to most efficiently
use real robot time, and how to leverage external data sources that aren't bottlenecked
by real robot hardware, such as simulation or large language / video models.

I graduated from the UC Berkeley Computer Science program in 2016, doing undergraduate
research in the [Berkeley Artificial Intelligence
Research (BAIR) Lab](http://bair.berkeley.edu/),
mentored by [Pieter Abbeel](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~pabbeel/) and
working most closely with [John Schulman](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~joschu/).
I was an Honorable Mention for the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship
Program.

During my last year of undergrad, I was very unsure whether I wanted to keep doing
research, and eventually decided not to apply to PhD programs (a blog post I wrote
around that time can be seen [here]({% post_url 2016-01-03-grad-school %})).
However, I have an offer from the Google AI Residency Program, and decided I would
try this research thing for one more year.
I ended up liking ML research and have been at Google ever since.
A comparison of industry research versus
academia PhD can be seen [here]({% post_url 2021-04-07-grad-school-5years %}).

As someone who started in math, I've always had a soft spot for
theoretical computer science. Outside of machine learning, I enjoy
complexity theory, theoretical cryptography, and mathematical logic, although I'm
not as good at those subjects as I used to be.

This site double as my personal blog.
Posts range from discussion about machine learning to observations
of my life and stupid jokes. I post whenever I have the time and motivation to
do so, meaning not very often. Historically I average about one post per
month.

In my free time, I primarily play card games and video games.
My main game is Dominion, which I play competitively. At my best, I was in
the top 20 worldwide. (These days it's more like top 500.) I'm a fan of
*My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic*,
and most of my music library is still made of [MLP or Touhou fan music](/recs).
I also do puzzlehunts. I've helped write multiple [hunts](/puzzles/), and am currently writing
MIT Mystery Hunt 2023 - which unfortunately is really cutting down on my blogging
time.

If you're here for my blog, you're probably here for my
[post about why deep RL doesn't work]({% post_url 2018-02-14-rl-hard %}),
which is by far my most popular, but while you're visiting, why don't you read
my post about [the Neopets economy]({% post_url 2018-11-10-neopets-economy %})?
