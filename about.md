*Last updated August 4, 2023.*

I currently work as a Research
Scientist on the Robotics@Google team, which is part of Google DeepMind. The views expressed on this blog are
personal opinions, and do not reflect the opinions of my employer.

My main research interest is deep reinforcement learning and imitation learning, as
applied to robotics.
In general, I like thinking about what's necessary to make robot learning work
for real-world problems. Much of my work has been based on how to most efficiently
use real robot time, how to leverage external data sources that aren't bottlenecked
by real robot hardware, and the challenges of longterm agent-centric data collection.

I graduated from the UC Berkeley Computer Science program in 2016, doing undergraduate
research in the [Berkeley Artificial Intelligence
Research (BAIR) Lab](http://bair.berkeley.edu/),
mentored by [Pieter Abbeel](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~pabbeel/) and
working most closely with [John Schulman](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~joschu/).
I was an Honorable Mention for the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship
Program.

During my last year of undergrad, I was very unsure whether I wanted to keep doing
research, and eventually decided not to apply to PhD programs (a blog post I wrote
around that time can be seen [here]({% post_url 2016-01-03-grad-school %})).
However, I have an offer from the Google AI Residency Program, and decided I would
try this research thing for one more year.
I ended up liking ML research and have been at Google ever since.
A comparison of industry research versus
academia PhD can be seen [here]({% post_url 2021-04-07-grad-school-5years %}).

As someone who started in math, I've always had a soft spot for
theoretical computer science. Outside of machine learning, I enjoy
complexity theory, theoretical cryptography, and mathematical logic, although I'm
not as good at those subjects as I used to be.

This site doubles as my personal blog.
Posts range from discussion about machine learning to observations
of my life and stupid jokes. I post whenever I have the time and motivation to
do so, meaning not very often. Historically I average about one post per
month.

In my free time, I primarily play card games and video games.
My main games are Magic: the Gathering and Dominion. I've never been very good at MTG,
but at my peak I was top 20 worldwide at Dominion. (These days it's more like top 500.)

I'm a lapsed fan of *My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic*. "Lapsed" because, well,
it's complicated, [I have a post]({% post_url 2021-12-31-why-mlp %}) covering why. I keep up with
little of the fandom these days, but much of my music library is still made of [MLP or Touhou fan music](/recs).

My other main hobby is puzzlehunts. I've solved them for around 10 years, and I've helped
write multiple hunts, including MIT Mystery Hunt 2023. A list of puzzles
I've written is [here](/puzzles/).

If you're here for my blog, you're probably here for my
[post about why deep RL doesn't work]({% post_url 2018-02-14-rl-hard %}),
which is by far my most popular, but while you're visiting, why don't you read
my post about [the Neopets economy]({% post_url 2018-11-10-neopets-economy %})?
