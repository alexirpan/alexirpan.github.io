How to Invent Everything is a book by Ryan North, of Dinosaur Comics fame. Its
premise is pretty simple - suppose your time machine broke, and you got stranded
in the past. You want to

1. Not die.
2. Recreate your modern life of luxury.

The book doesn't literally cover everything, but you can think of it as a civilization
reference book.
It starts from basic survival tip, building up to important
technologies like smelting metal, and then discussing fundamental science concepts
to relay to contemporary scientists to leapfrog several centuries of scientific progress.

That is what the book *is*, but that's different from what the book *can be viewed as*.
I'm pretty sure I did not read it the conventional way because I came away with some
weird takeaways.
