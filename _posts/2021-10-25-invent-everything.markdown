How to Invent Everything is a book by Ryan North, of Dinosaur Comics fame. Its
premise is pretty simple - suppose your time machine broke, and you got stranded
in the past. You want to

1. Not die.
2. Recreate your modern life of luxury.

The book doesn't literally cover everything, but you can think of it as a civilization
reference book.
It starts from basic survival tip, building up to important
technologies like smelting metal, and then discussing fundamental science concepts
to relay to contemporary scientists to leapfrog several centuries of scientific progress.

The main reason I like this book a lot is that it's very, very reductionist. For example,
let's say you're sent back to the 1400s. Then you can pretty easily invent the steam engine as long
as you can describe how it works, because the requisite techonlogies have been invented already.
But what if you're in prehistoric times, before smelting was invented? You'll need to invent that first.
But you'll also need to invent the technology to produce precisely shaped metal, to make the pistons
of your steam engine air-tight. To do that, you need standardized units of measure, so you'll need to
invent that too, and so on. That's not to say there are no abstractions. The premise is mostly an
excuse to talk about key inventions in history and when + how they were invented, and deliberately
ignores questions of how you convince people to build your designs.

Another reason is that it emphasizes the importance of information. One point the book hammers over
and over again is that many inventions could have been invented decades or centuries earlier than
they were, and the only reason is because people did not have the right ideas. It would be easy
to take away the theory that humans are dumb, and in some sense that's true. If you assume that
evolution increase intelligence very slowly, then the natural conclusion is that humanity
is the dumbest species that's smart enough to create civilization. So yes, we're dumb. But on
the other hand, when you read the "solution" to different technologies, it's sometimes hard to
fault humanity.

Take crop rotation for instance. If you grow the same crop every year without any fertilizer, those
crops will use up all the nitrogen in the soil. This makes crops grow worse each year until they
stop growing entirely. To fix this, you need to let the soil recover. The first way humanity fixed this
was to only grow crops every other year. On the other year, they let animals graze instead. The animal
poop reintroduced nitrogen to the soil, enabling a sustainable food supply. The main issue is that
now you're only achieving 50% efficiency, but eventually people learned that planting legumes like
clover helped replenish nitrogen thanks to their symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.

Now imagine you are a generic human around 10000 BC, the current estimate for when agriculture was invented.
You've just gotten a stable food supply, and know nothing about any of this nitrogen chemistry. Now someone
tells you that, no actually you aren't allowed to plant wheat yet, first you have to plant some legumes.
I
can't plant wheat
yet, you've got to plant a legume, but don't worry it'll make the soil last longer. 




Information is Everything
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Okay, I am 95% sure this was an intended takeaway.

How to Invent Everything has its origins in a smaller scale thought experiment: if you were
teleported back in time, and could introduce one new idea, at what point in time would you
have the biggest impact on the trajectory of human life?

Now

Ryan eventually gave a TED talk
about this, and given his computational linguistics background he somewhat obviously concluded
that language was the most important.

The thing is, I'm not sure he's wrong.
