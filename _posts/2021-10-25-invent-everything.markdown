How to Invent Everything is a book by Ryan North, of Dinosaur Comics fame. Its
premise is pretty simple - time travel is real! You've just used your time machine to go to the past,
but now it's broken and you're stranded there. You want to:

1. Not die.
2. Recreate your modern life of luxury.

How to Invent Everything doesn't literally cover everything, but you can view it as a book about
the highlights of civilization. It covers basic survival tips, building up to important technologies
like charcoal and the compass, then ending with fundamental science concepts and a basic intro to
computing and logic gates. Its main thesis is that with the right reference text (itself),
you could reproduce 12000 years of human progress in about 5 years of work.

Odds you're ever in the exact scenario of being trapped in the past? Vanishingly small. Still, it's
a fun read if you're interested in exploring how humanity improved its quality of life from first
principles.

The main reason I like this book a lot is that it's very, very reductionist. That necessarily falls from
the premise, but it makes it easy to trace the links between technological innovation. Steam engines
rely on precision engineering to make airtight pistons. That requires knowing how to make steel, and a standard set of
units for manufacturing. Steel requires knowing how to smelt iron, and that requires charcoal.
Sure, there are a lot of details to handle for getting the raw materials, and convincing people to
help you, but having the road map to the core of the Industrial Revolution is a big deal, and in reality
it took millenia to get from charcoal to steam.

This ties into a central theme of the book: over and over again, it points out the difference between
when inventioned were invented, and when they *could* have been invented. Often, the gap is many decades or
centuries. It'd be easy to conclude that humans are dumb, and in some sense that's true.
If you assume that evolution increase intelligence very slowly, and civilization appears as soon as an
organism is smart enough to make it,
then the natural conclusion is that humanity is the *dumbest* species that's smart enough to create civilization. So yes, we're dumb.

On the other hand, when you read the "solution" to different technologies, it's sometimes hard to fault
humanity. The prerequisites for the bicycle were around for a long time, but considering the design, it's
easy to see how minor changes can make the bicycle just a novelty, rather than a more efficient means of
transportation. (See [this post](https://rootsofprogress.org/why-did-we-wait-so-long-for-the-bicycle) by
Jason Crawford for more analysis.)

It's also easy to see how environmental factors might hamper innovtation.
Take crop rotation for instance. The core idea of crop rotation is that if you grow the same crop every
year, and haven't invented fertilizer yet, your crops
will use up all the nitrogen in the soil. The next year's crop is worse, and eventually the soil is no
longer fertile. To fix this, you can take years off and let grazing animals live there, since their
poop will reintroduce nitrogen. Alternatively, you can plant legumes like clover, which replenish nitrogen
thanks to their symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.

But, imagine you are a generic human around 10000 BC. You've just discovered the basics of farming, and
have reached an uneasy level of food security. Now some bozo is telling you to leave a perfectly good field alone
for long term sustainability. Are you going to listen to them?

Keep in mind that any crop experimenting is going to have a long delay to payoff, and if you mess it up,
people go hungry. It's easy to see why we don't have evidence of two-field crop rotation until 6000 BC,
and four-field crop rotation wasn't invented until around the [17th century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Agricultural_Revolution).
If you don't know any of the nitrogen chemistry, it seems very hard to discover the causal link between
crop sequencing and crop yields, especially given confounding factors like weather and rainfall.
