*Sorta Insightful* turns seven years old today!

Writing is not a muscle I have stretched very much recently. This is mostly because
I have been busy stretching puzzle construction muscles instead. If you are new here,
one of my hobbies is doing puzzlehunts. They're a bunch of fun, but making them is
a bunch of work.

Last year, I mentioned that I had been writing less because I was spending more
time writing puzzles. This January, the team I was on won MIT Mystery Hunt, the biggest
puzzle event of the year, and one of the rules of MIT Mystery Hunt is that if your
team wins, then your team writes it next year.

When I explain this to people, they say, "oh, that's neat". When I tell my parents
that we have a year to write MIT Mystery Hunt, they say, "oh, a year, that's far away,
there's no need to rush." It can take a while for me to explain that this is A Big
Deal, and that I've been spending 10-20 hrs/week since January working on making Mystery
Hunt a reality.

They say you carve out time for your hobbies, or else your work takes all your time. But what
do you do when your hobbies take time from your other hobbies? Boy do I not have a great
answer to that right now. But, I don't expect winning + writing MIT Mystery Hunt to be
a regular activity for me, so I've been treating this year as a write-off for blogging.
There should be more afterwards. (At minimum, I'll write a post about Mystery Hunt.)

# Highlights

I finally got that post about [My Little Pony]({% post_url 2021-12-31-why-mlp %}) done! Listen,
that post was a *struggle*. I'm pretty happy that it came together, and am
at peace with where I am with respect to the fandom. (Following very little, but still
following.)

Also, some papers I worked on came out, most notably [PaLM-SayCan](https://sites.research.google/palm-saycan).
I've been thinking more about AI recently (probably because I went to EA Global),
and it's kind of interesting to see-saw between people who think AI safety doesn't matter
because transformative AI is too far away, versus people who think it's 20% probability to
happen in 10 years and the default outcomes will be bad. My feelings on this are complicated
and I'll try to write more about
it at some point, but I would sum them up as, "sympathetic to people with short AI timelines,
not sure I'm on board with what they want to do about it."

# Statistics

## Word Count

Normally, I include word count of previous posts, but I'm deciding I'm no longer going to
track that data. I feel doing so is promoting the wrong idea - I would rather write concise
posts that take a while to edit, rather than longer posts that are longer than they
need to be.

Instead, I will just track post count. I wrote 7 posts this year. Three were written in the
MIT Mystery Hunt, and four were after.

# View Counts

These are the view counts from August 18, 2021 to today.

114 2022-07-14-twitter.markdown  
{% endhighlight %}

I'm a bit surprised the ML-related post has fewer views than the Mystery Hunt post. I guess most
people just read Twitter threads nowadays.


## Time Spent Writing

I spent **99 hours, 30 minutes** writing for my blog this year, about 40 minutes less than
last year. Now for context, 74 hours of that was before MIT Mystery Hunt, and 25 was after
MIT Mystery Hunt, so it's pretty clear where the time went.


# Posts in Limbo

**Post about measurement: dead**

I said I'd remove it from the list if I didn't write it this year. I didn't write it this year!
So it's gone. I'm guessing shades of this will appear in other future posts.

Part of the reason this post never happened is that I wanted to touch on the concept of legibility.
To do so, I figured I should read [Seeing Like a State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seeing_Like_a_State)
directly, since it was the book that popularized the idea, and it would be better to go to the
source rather than trust everyone's 2-sentence summary. Then I never finished Seeing Like a State
because it's kind of long and not written to be an easy read.

See this is why people just read Twitter summaries of papers and skip the paper itself. How
else would anybody get work done?


**Post about Gunnerkrigg Court: dead**

Shooooooooot. Look, Gunnerkrigg Court is sick. It is still one of my favorite comics of all time.
But, I'm not quite as hype about it as I was when I first archive binged it in 2015, and I've forgotten
the things I planned to say about it. The right time to write this post was about 2017, but I didn't,
and now I'm not in the right headspace for it.


**Post about My Little Pony: done**

WOOOOOOO

**Post about Dominion Online:**

Odds of writing this year: 5%  
Odds of writing eventually: 40%

I've come to realize that I like writing about things that I expect other people not to write about.
This is part of the "my cake sucks" problem.

**Post about puzzlehunts:**

Odds of writing this year: 20%  
Odds of writing eventually: 90%

I mean, yeah, this is just gonna happen one way or another.

**Post about Dustforce:**

Odds of writing this year: 5%
Odds of writing eventually: 50%

This is a new one I'm adding to the queue. Dustforce is a bit of a special game, in that most of my
die-hard games are from my childhood, but Dustforce is a die-hard game I started in college. It is both
really cool and really dense - I entirely understand why people bounce off this game, but I am
ride or die on it and need to explain *why*.
