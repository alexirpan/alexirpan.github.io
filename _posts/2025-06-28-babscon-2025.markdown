---

Bronies are older fans of *My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic*. They are mostly male, typically in 20s-30s age wise, and have been
trending older and more female over time. (A lot of girls in the original target
demographic grew up, and a lot of men in the fandom realized they were trans.)

Brony conventions are cons for the MLP fandom. Most have their roots
in the peak hype of the early 2010s, but many cons from that era are now defunct.
However, the core fan group attends enough to keep cons sustainable. At their peak,
con attendance would be in the thousands,
but these days attendance in the hundreds is more accurate.

BABSCon is one such convention. Short for Bay Area Brony Spectacular, it first ran in 2014,
and quickly became one of the mainstays (manestays?) of the brony convention circuit.
My first BABSCon was in 2016, and I've attended most years since. They've
been fun, but my interest has fallen over time.
The panels have started to repeat, the vendors have had less new merch,
and it's all just gotten less novel each year.
By BABSCon 2024, I had decided I wasn't going to any future iterations.
I'd gotten my fill.

Checking the news afterwards, I learn that con staff were ready to hang things up.
Next year's BABSCon, BABSCon 2025, would be the final one.

I may have fallen out of the con scene, but *of course* I had to go.


Okay But What Do You Do At My Little Pony Conventions
-------------------------------------------------------------

MLP conventions follow a similar template.

* Panels, where official MLP voice actors and writers answer questions, or fans present a pony or pony-adjacent topic.
* Vendor halls and artist alleys, where people sell art prints and fan merch.
* Gaming rooms, where people play video games, board games, or the defunct MLP CCG.
* Parties run out of hotel suites, to socialize while drinking cheap booze.
* A music concert in the evenings, typically set up as a rave with EDM or rock music made by brony musicians.

I've been to many of these conventions as a rando. For the final BABSCon, I felt I should give back to the community that had brought so much
entertainment over the years. So on a whim, I filled out a panel application titled
"Ponies and Puzzles".
I pitched a two-part panel. The first would analyze the design of the puzzles and riddles in My Little Pony. The second would be a solve-along of pony-themed puzzles
from puzzlehunts.
I explained why I wanted to run the panel, cited academic talks as evidence of my public speaking
experience, and linked [Puzzles are Magic](https://www.puzzlesaremagic.com/),
the MLP-themed puzzlehunt I led the design for back in 2020. This was all to convince
BABSCon that I am the most puzzle-pilled brony in the world and this was the talk I was *made* to
give, despite never giving it before. I thought competition to present at the final
BABSCon would be high, and wanted to put forward my best shot.

My panel was accepted! Which left me the task of actually, uh, writing and
preparing a 90 minute presentation.
Still, wasn't this what I signed up for? I procrastinate working on it, then start
grinding through the slides in the weeks leading up to BABSCon.

Three weeks before the official date, I get an email from the events coordinator of BABSCon.

> Hello,
>
> If you are receiving this email then you were accepted to be a panelist at BABSCon 2025.
>
> tl;dr I'm hosting open calls to talk about the schedule.

Panelists were expected to attend one of these calls to coordinate a desired
panel time.
In particular, if there were other panels we knew we wanted to attend, they could shuffle the
schedule to make sure our panel wouldn't conflict with those panels. Somehow, I've never realized
this is how con scheduling works. At academic conferences, the schedule is
decided for you.

I figured that panel spots would be first-come first-served, so I went to the first time I could
make, the end of the Friday 4-6 PM call. I wasn't free until late, but
luckily, the host was willing to stay until they got to everyone.
The first thing I heard in the call was about a panel that was normally
held under a stairwell at night, so we were off to a great start.

Before they got to my place in line, the host said they had to take another call. Alright, no problem. I go back to working on
the slides for my panel. At 6:05 PM, the host comes back, says that other call
has evolved into an emergency, and they'll need to stop today's panel call early.
Annoying, but I get that event organizing can be hectic.
I pencil in joining the next open call on Saturday.

Saturday morning arrives. I check my email, and:

> Hi all,
>
> Thank you everyone that came yesterday, I found it very successful and have a much better grasp on panelist needs.
>
> I regret to inform you that due to the ongoing situation I will need to cancel the schedule forum today.
>
> I believe everyone involved tried to do what they thought was best and it is more than unfortunate this conflict came to head in the way it did, when it did.
>
> We are moving forward with what we have, and despite the circumstances, compared to a week ago I am more confident in our ability to pull things off now than I was then. I will wait for an official statement to be decided before speaking on that further.
>
> This in no way affects the evaluation of any panel and I likewise completely understand anyone who needs to cancel. Obviously there may be changes to the schedule in the next few days. I will plan to resume with forum calls on Sunday (tomorrow) and will send an earlier notification than this if the situation changes.

??????

Sorry, what?

I don't read brony social media, so I have no idea what drama is going down. But it's clear that *something* is
going on, it's escalated hard, and it's hit the point where con staff assumes everyone obviously knows what the "ongoing situation" is.
Except I don't. So...what?

With some trepidation, I open the BABSCon Discord, and there is a fire, burning bright.


The Situation
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I've decided not to name anyone besides Pinkaboo, the central figure of the story. The names are easy
to find if you really need to know.

Pinkaboo was the music concert coordinator for BABSCon. She has been involved in organizing
pony music concerts for several years, for both BABSCon and other pony conventions.
Because of this, she is widely liked by the brony musician community, but not well known outside of that group, due to playing more of a background logistics role.

On Friday 6:18 PM, the musicians get an email saying Pinkaboo was fired from BABSCon. (This is 13 minutes after the panel call was cut short, for those keeping track.)
It's possible some knew earlier, but I believe this email is the first time the musicians learn of her firing.

> Hello everyone,
> We wanted to inform you directly that the BABSCon Chairs have made the decision to reorganize
> responsibilities over the Neighhem concert. Moving forward, [name] will assume acting responsibility
> as Concert Lead, while we finish interviewing an individual to assume the role full time. Pinkaboo
> is no longer a member of BABSCon staff; her status as a musician remains unchanged.
>
> To be clear, this decision does not impact the existing plans for Neighhem: The set schedule will
> remain as planned. Musician benefits will remains as previously agreed upon, including the gratis
> party suite rooms, which continue to be under Pinkaboo's purview as private guest rooms.
>
> Moving forward, for official convention business, we have created a channel for Concert's exclusive
> use on the BABSCon server, [link]. We can also be reached via email at [email].
>
> As we approach the finish line, we acknowledge Pinkaboo's work building the strong foundation of
> Neighhem at BABSCon. This is a contribution which we will continue to recognize and acknowledge.
>
> Thank you,
> BABSCon Chairs

The brony musicians immediately get into an emergency Discord call with Pinkaboo to get her side
of the story. They quickly decide the BABSCon Chairs are talking out of their ass, do not deserve their respect,
and make a coordinated social media blast announcing they are all dropping out of the concert in
protest.

It is 3 weeks before the last BABSCon, and one of the major evening activities no longer exists.

This continues blowing up the Discord into Saturday, with no official statement
from the con chairs. (Although some con chairs directly reply to angry attendees
in Discord, for some reason.)
This makes it hard to find exactly why Pinkaboo was fired. A rumor goes around
that Pinkaboo was fired
for sending a passive-aggressive tweet reply when BABSCon staff shared the
wrong draft of a concert marketing video on social media. This was never directly
confirmed, I've yet to find any evidence of this, and if it ever existed, it was deleted before anyone could archive it.

On Saturday night, the BABSCon chairs put out their first statement.

> I do want to apologize for the sudden news that broke yesterday, the ripples it sent throughout the community, and how it affected everyone who has planned on attending BABSCon. Our approach to this situation has been to remain respectful of all parties and refrain from divulging sensitive information; however, this approach has led to misunderstandings and understandable concerns from our staff, guests, and attendees. We would like to shed some clarity on a couple specific situations we have seen being discussed publicly, which are excellent examples of multiple perspectives:
>
> In regards to the concerns with Marketing, we agree Pinkaboo was very engaged with the musicians' unique marketing needs, and extensively pushed to have them promoted. It is important to recognize that Pinkaboo worked with us to pre-write and pre-approve all the musician announcement posts. Unfortunately when those marketing pushes did not go well, Marketing was blamed and bared the backlash. Then when Marketing didn't respond fast enough, they were blamed again. This occurred multiple times.
>
> In regards to Musician compensation, we hear reports of all the work Pinkaboo has done to take care of the musician community. One example was letting them stay in her suite so they do not need to pay for their own hotels. That suite, the connecting rooms, and several other rooms, are all paid by BABSCon as part of Concert's budget. Those details of the budget Pinkaboo received, and how she chose to allocate it to the musicians she invited, seem to have been obfuscated from the musicians themselves.
> Do we wish we could pay more for the musicians? Absolutely! The costs to host the concert were already higher than all of the rest of our Panels, Events, Arcade, Tabletop, CCG, Cosplay, and Theatrics budgets all combined, and we worked to stretch it across 50+ musicians as much as we could. We are sorry the details of that were never clearly communicated to the musicians directly.
>
> Internally to staff, there were multiple other situations where statements and allegations Pinkaboo made were, upon review, found to be false.
>
> This leads to the core of the matter – the Chairs have repeatedly seen Pinkaboo twist the truth and serve as an unreliable narrator within our staff team. This issue only grew worse with time, and with three weeks until the convention, it had become an issue we could no longer work around. Part of operating as a team is being able to trust your teammates to accurately and truthfully present information. Pinkaboo lost that trust, and she was removed from staff.

This says a lot of things, while not clearing up anything.
Saying Pinkaboo was an unreliable narrator without providing examples is like the OpenAI board saying
Sam Altman was not consistently candid without specifying how. Sure, there's
some element of truth, but you have to give more than that. Similar to that
situation, this statement doesn't bring anyone to BABSCon's side.


My View
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

In general, I assume social media hate mobs aren't fair to the people they're
hating on. So here's my most charitable interpretation of what happened.

In a bid to incentivize brony musicians to show up for the last BABSCon, I'd
guess Pinkaboo spent a lot of the budget allocated to her, and pushed BABSCon
for more. These incentives were **massively** successful, because the concert lineup
is stacked, with many who haven't performed their music live in years.
Half the lineup could be the headliner at an average brony concert.
Making this happen was likely expensive, and I get the impression Pinkaboo
has more of a begrudging relationship with BABSCon rather than one with constructive criticism.

On Friday, Pinkaboo messed up *something*. In normal circumstances, it would
be resolved internally, but leadership was sick of working with her. So
they took the opportunity to snowball that mistake into
an excuse to fire her, thinking this would remove a headache from their lives.
This backfired horribly.

Now, as con chairs, they have the authority to fire anybody. No one says they *can't* fire their
music head. Everyone's saying it's dumb they *did*. It's the final BABSCon!
If the chairs are sick of working with Pinkaboo, is working 3 more weeks before never having to work with
her again really so impossible? Let her finish her job. If the concert goes
wrong, you even get to blame her in the end, since it's her responsiblity.
And if it goes well, you don't have to air any dirty laundry. How is this so hard?

The musicians in particular are pissed off because they know who Pinkaboo is, and are directly aware of the
work she's done to support them. Firing someone from the concert they've been planning for months, *and
then saying they can still perform in it if they want*, is just a crazy level of tone-deafness over what
these concerts mean to the musicians performing in them.

This is not lost on the general BABSCon public. In the end, it's all people, but the situation is very similar
to the story of a big corporation (BABSCon) firing a productive worker (Pinkaboo)
the moments things go slightly wrong, ignoring their years of service.
And, like most terminally online fandoms, MLP fans are *very* leftist, so they
quickly support the musicians' strike.

<p class="centered">
<img alt="Socialist MLP stickers" src="/public/babscon-2025/socialist_stickers.jpg" style="max-width: 60%"/>
</p>

I come out of everything agreeing with them. In a game of he said she said, what matters is reputation. Pinkaboo has it. The con does not.


Fallout
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Normally, music artists sign contracts with the con to get agreements on what the con will give
the musicians. (For example, Odyssey said she's contractually obligated to
play [Discord](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDMGv3hNMes) at her sets, which - understandable.)
Before deciding to strike, the musicians reread their contracts. They argue
that all the contracts are signed with Pinkaboo rather than BABSCon, so
the terms of those contracts no longer apply after Pinkaboo's firing.

BABSCon staff disagrees, saying that any common sense interpretation is that the contracts
are from Pinkaboo on behalf of BABSCon, rather than Pinkaboo individually. I take BABSCon's side of this
dispute, but they never pursue collecting on those contracts because it won't
fix their fundamental problem of losing all their music talent.

Other conventions start tweeting in support of the brony musicians, with no one taking BABSCon's side.
Some individuals start airing out dirty laundry from previous BABSCon iterations, alleging BABSCon has a history of treating
talent poorly. My opinion is not moved by that laundry.
I assume all conventions have internal drama by default, because logistics is hell and hell is a
pressure cooker. To make a convention happen, you must make fast decisions with imperfect info.
Any longrunning convention will, eventually, ban an innocent person for sexual harassment. Or fail to screen a stalker for a visiting celebrity, or something else.
I'm not surprised that people have bad things to say about BABSCon, now that
it's publicly acceptable to dunk on them.

Con staff and the former BABSCon musicians go into negotiation, to see if there's any way forward.
The musicians' give their conditions for performing again:

* Pinkaboo must be reinstated as concert head.
* BABSCon head of staff must step down.

BABSCon staff refuses. Now, in my opinion, firing your music lead 3 weeks before con is dumb.
Firing your head of staff 3 weeks before con is just suicidal. As angry as the musicians are about
the concert, they consistently tell people to still attend BABSCon. Many are friends with artists in the community, who rely on con attendees for
personal income. Everyone (everypony) still wants the rest of the convention to be great.

Unfortunately for me, the concert really was the main thing I was looking forward to. I was mildly
into brony music pre-2020, and then fell deep, deep into the rabbit hole as a side effect of writing
[Recommendations](https://www.puzzlesaremagic.com/puzzle/recommendations.html) for
Puzzles are Magic. It's hard to me to explain *why* I like MLP fan music, because brony music
is really not accessible. The scene has evolved from "haha mild remix of song from MLP episodes" to
["metal song about Sweetiebot from the Friendship is Witchcraft AU that last updated 10 years ago"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44ugTb3nZec).
That was one of the *bigger* songs of the year. These days an MLP song is likely to have minimal pony
references, only implying a side story that happens to have ponies in it.

The best explanation I have for how this all "works" is that if you're a fan of My Little Pony,
you automatically give some slack to music made by other fans of My Little Pony, because they clearly
have good taste. Then the music recommendation algorithms hijack the existing fandom
social fabric to introduce you to new artists, that all build off each other's work in a small reference pool that lets you feel like you're in something special.
Pretty soon you're radicalized into getting emotional over a song about [a unicorn that rediscovers
her love of music by whispering to fish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-u9O2eG8qQ). Now that's a story about life.

Of the artists in the cancelled BABSCon 2025 lineup, the one I was most looking forward
to was Vylet Pony. I was introduced to Vylet through
4everfreebrony's cover of [Little Dreams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA8ZjlPHlaU), then went down her discography from there. Out of her older work, I really like [Overrun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reavAI1hqrM),
but by far her most famous song is ANTONYMPH. Its music video, a love letter to the Internet of the early 2010s, is a tour de force of nostalgia that kicked off its own
subfandom. You'll usually see at least one Fluttgirshy cosplay at any MLP con.

</p>

I am partial to the [lyra.horse](https://lyra.horse/antonymph/) version, an in-browser audiovisual experience made by a trans horse infosec researcher. Nothing about that sentence
is surprising if you've spent enough time online, which I unfortunately have.

In the years since, Vylet
Pony has amassed an eclectic diehard fanbase. Common themes in her work
are "don't be afraid to like what you like" and loving yourself. I'd include
myself as a fan. Her work is so unabashed of its inspirations that it circles
to being endearing. There is no subtlety: everything is *here* and you gotta take it. In practice, this means I often *really* like
half of a Vylet Pony song and then hate the other half, but it also means that
when a song hits on all cylinders for me, it hits very hard.

Vylet Pony also basically never performs at conventions, having last performed
at the final BronyCon in 2019. She was one of the musicians most outspoken
about how she only agreed to perform at BABSCon because she trusted Pinkaboo to keep everything together.
I also suspected she only agreed to BABSCon because she originally grew up in the Bay Area, and wanted to revisit the area to reflect on how she's changed.
So I was assuming this was the one and only live Vylet Pony performance I'd get
to see, and now it's gone.

Well, *maybe* it's gone.


Asgard Is Not A Place
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All the brony musicians who were going to perform are still flying into Bay Area for the BABSCon weekend. If everypony's going to be in the same place at the same time,
who says they can't perform somewhere else?

On its face, it is insane to move a concert to an entirely new venue in 3 weeks.
However, is this any more insane than BABSCon trying to replace all their music talent
in 3 weeks against a hostile crowd? Not really, and the musicians are the ones with the means of production.

Real traction begins when 15 comes out of hibernation to offer up to $5000 towards running a new concert.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I&#39;ll pay at least like $5,000 to help secure a new location for the concert if it&#39;s still happening (seriously), I was looking really forward to it 😔 <a href="https://t.co/1gisC5VE0E">https://t.co/1gisC5VE0E</a></p>&mdash; 15 🔜 TrotCon (@fifteenai) <a href="https://twitter.com/fifteenai/status/1905882472845627529?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 29, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

A bit of lore: 15.ai is a free MLP voice generation site run by an anonymous AI researcher who went by the name 15. They worked on voice generation
before it was cool, and in my opinion, when the site launched in 2020, their model was arguably
the highest quality audio generation model in the world. Like, better quality than the models trained by
Google. 15 credited this to the very high quality annotations of MLP speech data by the Pony Preservation
Project from 4chan. Running 15.ai was expensive, given how much GPU time it was burning, but they never compromised on keeping the site free.
This made then a celebrity in the fandom - "horse famous", as it were. These days, AI voice generation is a lot more
serious and controversial, but multiple modern AI voice generation startups credit 15.ai for creating the market they now compete over. (See [the 15.ai Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15.ai)
if you want to learn more.)

15 is known for being reclusive, so breaking their silence for the BABSCon situation was a big, big deal.
Over the weekend, the idea gained momentum, and soon turned from idea to official project.
Brony musicians began advertising the alternative concert in the BABSCon Discord, calling it "Pinkaboo's Neighhem".
The name is not an accident. It is a proverbial middle finger to BABSCon,
and a reclaiming of a name that they feel the con no longer deserves.

This sparks some infighting among BABSCon staff.
BABSCon staff has a lot of volunteers, many of whom disagree
with how Pinkaboo was handled. They are respecting the authority of the con chairs, but they aren't happy about it.
At the same time, Pinkaboo haters understand that her story is now woven into the
story of BABSCon, and they cannot silence it, so they end up creating
a #neighhem-planning containment channel in the Discord and ignore it the best
they can.

Through a mix of outreach, GoFundMe, and a desire to make everything so far not be for nothing,
Pinkaboo's Neighhem reaches its funding goal and is officially announced a few days later.

* It will be held on Sunday evening, at the Fox Theatre in downtown Redwood City. This deliberately starts
after BABSCon's scheduled closing ceremony on Sunday afternoon, to avoid competing with the con.
* Neighhem will be free, even for people who didn't register for BABSCon. Donations are welcome to help cover costs.
A limited amount of concert merch will be on sale, along with a small artist alley.
* The music schedule will be heavily compressed, but most of the original
lineup will still perform, including Vylet Pony.
* Thanks to sponsors, there will be free shuttle buses taking people from the BABSCon hotel to the
Fox Theatre and back.
* Most importantly,

GO TO THE BUCKING CONCERT!

Meanwhile: What's BABSCon Doing?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BABSCon chairs successfully pull together a new set of evening activities,
headlined by one shorter set by Mystery Skulls.
This is pretty impressive, since Mystery Skulls is a "real" (professional) music artist that goes on tour. Their
connection to brony fandom is via owing a lot of their popularity to the Mystery Skulls Animated
series by MysteryBen27, an animator from the early 2010s brony scene. Mystery Skulls Animated is good, if you haven't seen it.
It's the kind of series that raises more questions than it answers, with smooth
animation filled with details you only notice on your 3rd viewing.
[Go watch it!](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0fvOtjetDLFH_avalzdmSLL91rvwiE07)

Mystery Skulls was scheduled to perform at BABSCon 2020, before it was shut down due to COVID.
So they already had a working relationship with BABSCon. In some ways, this is arguably a make-up set
for the one they should have played 5 years ago.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Excited to announce I will be performing at <a href="https://twitter.com/BABSCon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@BABSCon</a><br>this year!! <br>go to <a href="https://t.co/k5NeRt6wFc">https://t.co/k5NeRt6wFc</a> to get your badge!

As someone connected to but outside of the fandom, they're not seen as a strikebreaker in the way that
a brony musician would be viewed. I mean, they are breaking the strike, but that implies the strikers
have any intention to come back. They don't. So, whatever.

With this, people point out that somehow, everyone's gotten what they wanted.
BABSCon doesn't have to deal with Pinkaboo. The brony musicians don't have to deal with BABSCon.
If you wanted to see a concert, now you have two concerts. The official BABSCon concert (now called
Burning Mare) is much shorter, and the slack in the schedule is used to move many panels to
larger rooms. My panel benefits from this - I get upgraded from a side room further away from the main hub
to one of the three main panel rooms. There are still hard feelings, but the average con goer experience
really did get better. The breakup is bad, but the divorce is clean.

With the drama resolved, I can stop doomscrolling the BABSCon Discord, and focus on
what's important: making my panel the best it can be, to play my part in making
the con what it is.


BABSCon, One Last Time
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When I get to the con, I ask if panelists get a special badge. They don't, so I just pick up a regular badge
and the official conbook. It may just be
my imagination, but the page advertising Mystery Skulls feels like it is made of noticably different paperstock.

I immediately head to the con store, because I'm pretty confident they will run out
if I wait. I come out with a BABSCon 2025 T-shirt and a coin from leftover BABSCon 2024 merch. My call is correct: the T-shirts sell out by the end of the first day.

There isn't too much to comment on for the rest of the con. As I said, I've been to enough of these to know what
to expect. When I walk into the vendor hall, I do a quick once over, confirm I've seen
most the vendors before, and skip most of the booths. I do end up buying some prints from
one of the MLP comics artists that's attending BABSCon for the first and final time, and some tiny laser-burned
wooden pony pieces that were 25 cents each from a gachapon setup.

There is a brief protest for Pinkaboo, but it is very brief.
A bunch of people in fursuits carry a "We Support Pinkaboo!" flag, pose for a photo op, then disperse.

![Pinkaboo protest](/public/babscon-2025/pinkaboo_protest.jpg)
{: .centered }

The food is overpriced, but the gaming area is fun. One of my favorite BABSCon memories from past years is playing 3 hours of Smash 64 against someone continuously salting about how bullshit Kirby is while wearing Trixie cosplay.
Just, 10/10 no notes.
Unfortunately, the gaming has shifted heavily to Smash Ultimate and Them's Fightin' Herds, neither of
which I got very into.

The panels are fun. One is a livecast of a modded WWE game, changing all the wrestlers to look like MLP
characters. Another goes through a leaked [Hasbro document](https://www.equestriadaily.com/2025/02/what-did-hasbro-think-of-us-in-early.html)
from early brony fandom, written to help internal employees get up to speed on the fandom.
Now it unintentionally acts as a 2011 time capsule. They have a whole section for
Steven Magnet. When's the last time anyone's thought about Steven Magnet? Or used
this meme template?

![A Yo Dawg meme about Big Mac](/public/babscon-2025/big_mac_meme.png)
{: .centered }

When it gets close to the time for my panel, I head over early for setup. I'm not sure if con staff will be there to assist me
or not. When I see no one there, I set it up myself. I'm a bit nervous, but as the panel starts I shift into "presenter mode" and the nerves go away.
From my standpoint, the panel goes well. I have to live-debug fixing computer audio in the middle,
but people are engaged the whole time, and have good questions at the end about puzzle design. After my analysis of the two in-universe My Little Pony
escape rooms (yes, there are two of them),
I run a solve along of [Bottom Lines](https://dp.puzzlehunt.net/puzzle/bottom-lines.html) from DP Puzzle Hunt,
[Power](https://deusovi.github.io/puzzlefiles/zelda-minihunt.pdf) puzzle from Deusovi's Zelda Minihunt, and [Art of the Dress](https://www.puzzlesaremagic.com/puzzle/art-of-the-dress.html) from Puzzles are Magic. We go a bit over time, but it's 30 minutes until the next panel, so I end up
livestreaming a group crossword solve of [Cross Eyed](https://www.puzzlesaremagic.com/puzzle/cross-eyed.html) from Puzzles are Magic
until we are kicked out. Hopefully I've converted at least one person to
puzzlehunts.

With that, there is pretty much nothing left for me to do, besides going to room parties and waiting for
Mystery Skulls. I stop by the British themed room party, where I
meet a life-size cardboard cutout of King Charles, eat a bunch of snacks they've brought from the UK just for the bit, and
chat with one of the organizers of [PonyCon Holland](https://ponyconholland.com/). He is on a mission to
convince people to travel to the EU pony circuit. I mention that I was just in London a few months ago,
and he complains that visiting London only means you've been to London. It doesn't mean I've been to Britain. I ask what would count as visiting Britain - he says "anywhere but London".

We talk a bit about pony cons outside the US, and the
recent explosion of the Chinese bronycon scene. I don't follow Chinese brony fandom much, but have
My Little Pony is massive over there; it feels like China
is 10 years behind the US, and they are living through the 2015-2016 peak of MLP popularity, with new conventions
appearing every year.
Most new merch these days is made for China first, and I'm surprised there aren't
many resellers at the vendor hall. I figured at least
one person would be trying to profit off them. I guess the demand for non-English merch is just too low.

In the US, the massive growth of MLP was followed by a contraction where cons died off.
Hopefully that doesn't happen to the Chinese scene, but it'll depend how much staying power MLP has.
I hope to see debates over 虹林檎 vs 稀有苹果 for many more years.


The final BABSCon wraps up with its charity auction, which I am quickly priced out of.
As closing ceremonies begin, a few people start boarding the shuttles that have arrived to take people to
Pinkaboo's Neighhem. I am not enough of a pony music person to skip the literal final BABSCon closing ceremony,
but it does have an odd sense of penultimateness to it. The real finale's in Redwood City.


Pinkaboo's Neighhem
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

{: .centered }

To borrow a saying from the youth, the vibes are immaculate. The entire concert
feels like one huge after party, complete with a custom drinks menu at the bar. According to the organizers, Pinkaboo's Neighhem got over 1000 signups on their Eventbrite, compared to 2000 registrations for BABSCon 2025.
It's unclear how many people actually showed up, but half the convention looks
accurate to me.
It's pretty good turnout for a last minute unofficial event.
Turns out you *can* just move a concert if everypony wants to make it happen.

The Mystery Skulls set at BABSCon was fun, but Neighhem is beating it on all dimensions.
The venue is nicer. The concert setup is more elaborate, with a larger stage
and more audiovisuals. The performer callouts are more specific to MLP fandom.
It feels more like a *pony* rave rather than just a rave.

I stick around until the schedule gets to an act I'm less excited about, and leave
to get dinner at Marufuku. (Another upside: being close to good food.)
As I walk back to the venue, boba in hand, security stops me and tells me no outside drinks are allowed.
So I drink my boba outside, suddenly feeling self-conscious about the MLP hoodie and jersey I am still wearing.
But this fades quickly when I remember that cringe is defeated by both
safety in numbers and not giving a shit.
in public.

> When I wore my fursuit on my college campus for Halloween I had many peers who thought they were a spectator to the cringe show that I was, and they’d record me or look and talk about me from far away in their groups- unaware of how good my head’s visibility is. When I noticed someone recording or jeering, I waved and I posed, and they’d either immediately look away or act like it was not me they were recording. They didn’t realize the show was interactive! We have this kind of drive to cringe at and feel better than others, assuming they are static and detached from us, but in reality (especially as we see it now) the “other” might be starkly aware of you.

In the crowd outside, I spot someone who I remember gave a talk about MLP generative AI at a previous
BABSCon, and I say hi. In retrospect, I realize I did not introduce myself at all, and, oops that
made things awkward. We briefly talk about the state of rationalist discourse. It turns out you cannot escape rationalist
discussion if you are in the Bay Area and talk about AI, even outside of a My Little Pony concert.

I go back into the concert area, picking up a poster since T-shirts in my size are sold out. By the end
of the night, Neighhem will have sold literally all merch they made.
I alternate between the dance floor area and the cool-down balcony on the top floor.

Midway through one of the sets, there's a medical emergency, where someone dislocates their knee and can't get back up. EMTs are on-site, and organizers stop the set to allow the medical professionals to attend to them.
As far as I know, the person who fell was just clumsy and got too excited, but out of an abundance of caution
the bar cuts off alcohol for the night. Which unfortunately means I never get to try the custom "Pinkaboo" or "Eurobeat Brony" cocktails.)

Concert staff release balloons into the crowd, and for the next few hours, there is a minigame
of "keep the balloon in the air". People start leaving as the night continues, but I am committed to seeing the Vylet Pony and Odyssey sets, even if it wrecks my
sleep schedule.

At midnight, Vylet Pony takes the stage to much cheering. Her set doesn't include anything from Monarch of Monsters, but I wasn't really expecting it to -
it's not a particularly good "dancing" album.
Based on crowd reactions, it is very obvious that most people are here
for ANTONYMPH, but I'm happy to recognize songs from Super Pony World,
I Was The Loner of Paradise Valley,
and [Creature City](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJr-_KWPRNc), one of my favorite songs from 2024. Shelly the Android Lobster forever.

That leaves the final set of Odyssey. Like always, her stage presence is great, and
the venue is still packed at 1 AM.
When it gets to Luna and Discord,
the crowd shouts out the lyrics, because yes, here everyone knows the lyrics. Part of me wonders
how much Odyssey likes playing songs from over a decade ago, compared to her new work with way fewer views. But the old brony songs are the
ones that pay the bills, cultural touchstones in a fandom that's been buffeted and weathered but somehow
never quite died. BABSCon is over for good, but pony fandom continues.

The BABSCon Discord is now mostly dormant, having turned into yet another MLP chatting Discord but with a Bay Area lean.

The musicians go back from whence they came. Some are still active in the MLP music scene, while others
have either stopped making music or work professionally under other aliases. A
few months after BABSCon, Vylet Pony releases her
new album, [Love & Ponystep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKpsl3tJmIU). To quote a review, it is "fearlessly cringe", and I love it. The album beats you over
the head with its inspirations, and that makes it feel real.
Fan of "Peace, Love, Glalie", "Wonka X Howl", and "Falling in Love With a Corporate Illustration" so far.

The Pinkaboo Neighhem Discord also goes dormant, now functioning as another
MLP music discussion space. Several months later, Pinkaboo announces that after paying musicians and staff their fees, Neighhem had $1500 left over, which
was donated to the music program at [New Horizon School](https://www.newhorizonschool.info/), a school for students with learning disabilities. She teases a new
non-convention concert, but so far, it's just that, a teaser.

Recently, as my blogging profile has grown, I've wondered how much time to spend
on stories like these, rather than more "professional" ones. But when I started
writing publicly, I did it for one reason, to write what I wanted to write about
and not write what I didn't want to write about. So, screw it, this post is going up.
The point of pointless stories is to tell them.
It's okay to do things for you, even and especially if they aren't legible to others.

As for My Little Pony, it continues to chug on. There's speculation that Hasbro
will leverage their Chinese popularity to do a big marketing push for the Year of
the Horse in 2026. And as of last week, Variety's reported that [a live-action
MLP movie](https://variety.com/2025/film/news/my-little-pony-movie-live-action-amazon-mgm-hasbro-1236461858/) is in the works. No one is excited by this news, the track
record of live-action reboots is really not good, but I remember when Friendship is
Magic was written off as a trash cash-in cartoon. Then it started airing, and now
Twilight Sparkle is a cultural icon. I hope the movie's good. For now, all there is
to do is celebrate what we have and wait for what's new.
