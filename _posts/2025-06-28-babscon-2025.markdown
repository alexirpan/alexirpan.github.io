The point of pointless stories is to tell them.

First, some background. Bronies are older fans of My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic,
typically teenager age or older, predominantly male. At least that's how it used to be,
the ratios have shifted to be more female over time. It had a moment in the early 2010s,
spawning a bunch of MLP fan conventions, or brony conventions. Many of these cons are now
dead, but some still run, and the dedicated core fan community still attends enough of them
to keep it sustainable. At their peak, attendance would be in the thousands. These days
it's around 200-800.

BABSCon, short for Bay Area Brony Spectacular, was one such event. They first ran in 2014,
and quickly became one of the mainstays (manestays?) of the brony convention circuit.
My first BABSCon was in 2016, and I attended most years ever since. I never did
a great job at actually making long-lasting friends from these conventions, but they were
fun. For me, they evolved from "OMG, everything is new and amazing" to "oh, I recognize
this vendor from last year, and I've been to this panel before, and I've heard this
story before", and so on. As I left BABSCon 2024, I decided I was no longer attending BABSCon.
I'd gotten my fill, I was running out of merch I wanted to buy, and it just didn't
feel worth my time anymore.

Then at closing ceremonies, they announced that BABSCon 2025 would be the *final* BABSCon.
The organizing staff wanted to move on. I may have fallen out of the con scene, but
*of course* I had to go.

What transpired turned into an almost perfect cross-section of my life. And we haven't even
gotten to the music yet.

\* \* \*
{: .centered }

A brony convention can very broadly be sliced into these pieces:

* Panels, where official MLP voice actors and writers answer questions, or fans present a
pony-adjacent topic.
* Vendor halls and artist alleys, where fans sell art prints and fan merch.
* Gaming rooms (with board gaming, video gaming, and card gaming all represented).
* A concert area in the evenings.

For the final BABSCon, I felt I should give back the community that had brought so much
entertainment and joy to me over the years. On a whim, I filled out a panel application titled
"Ponies and Puzzles". In it, I pitched a two-part panel. The first would cover puzzle
design, and rank the puzzles and riddles which appeared in My Little Pony. (There are
a surprisingly large number of these, since the show has homaged both detective fiction
and adventure fiction.) The second would be an introduction to puzzlehunts. I explained why
I wanted to run this panel, pointed to academic talks I'd given before as evidence of
public speaking experience, and linked [Puzzles are Magic](https://www.puzzlesaremagic.com/),
the MLP-themed puzzlehunt I led the design for back in 2020. I am the most puzzle-pilled
brony in the world, this is the talk I was made for.

The panel was accepted! Which left me the task of preparing a 90 minute talk. Oops. Still,
wasn't this what I signed up for? As I worked on sourcing episode clips and deciding what to
keep and what to cut, I got an email from the events coordinator of BABSCon.

> Hello,
>
> If you are receiving this email then you were accepted to be a panelist at BABSCon 2025.
>
> tl;dr I'm hosting open calls to talk about the schedule.

Panelists were expected to attend one of the open calls, to discuss their audiovisual (AV) requirements,
desired time slots, room constraints, and so on. The way it worked was that the events coordinator
would host a Zoom call, panelists would drop in whenever they were free, and would be called on in
order to chat for 2-5 minutes to find what time worked for them. Figuring that panel slots would be
taken in a first-come first-served basis, I went to the first one I could make, the tail-end of the
Friday evening timeslot. By the time I got in the call, I was around 8th in line. The first thing I heard
was "I normally host this panel under a stairway, since I haven't gotten to run it officially yet",
so we were off to a great start.

When I was 3rd in line, the host said they had to take a call. Alright, no problem. They then said
that the situation had evolved into an emergency, and they'd need to cut the call early. Unfortunate,
but understandable. The next open call would be tomorrow, on Saturday.

On Saturday morning, I see the following email.

> Hi all,
>
> Thank you everyone that came yesterday, I found it very successful and have a much better grasp on panelist needs.
>
> I regret to inform you that due to the ongoing situation I will need to cancel the schedule forum today. 
>
> I believe everyone involved tried to do what they thought was best and it is more than unfortunate this conflict came to head in the way it did, when it did. 
>
> We are moving forward with what we have, and despite the circumstances, compared to a week ago I am more confident in our ability to pull things off now than I was then. I will wait for an official statement to be decided before speaking on that further.
>
> This in no way affects the evaluation of any panel and I likewise completely understand anyone who needs to cancel. Obviously there may be changes to the schedule in the next few days. I will plan to resume with forum calls on Sunday (tomorrow) and will send an earlier notification than this if the situation changes.

I have **no idea** what this is referencing. All I know is that there is drama and it's escalated *hard*.
I am not on Pony Twitter (because I'm not on Twitter in general), but I am in the BABSCon Discord. So
I open it for the first time in a long while.


The Firing
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pinkaboo was the music concert coordinator for BABSCon. She has been involved in organizing previous
concerts for both BABSCon and other pony conventions for many years, and is widely liked by
the brony musician community.

During the Friday where panels were getting coordinated, Pinkaboo was fired by the head of BABSCon.

Now, let's play a game. My first entrypoint into this drama was reading the statement put out by con staff.

> I do want to apologize for the sudden news that broke yesterday, the ripples it sent throughout the community, and how it affected everyone who has planned on attending BABSCon. Our approach to this situation has been to remain respectful of all parties and refrain from divulging sensitive information; however, this approach has led to misunderstandings and understandable concerns from our staff, guests, and attendees. We would like to shed some clarity on a couple specific situations we have seen being discussed publicly, which are excellent examples of multiple perspectives:
>
> In regards to the concerns with Marketing, we agree Pinkaboo was very engaged with the musicians' unique marketing needs, and extensively pushed to have them promoted. It is important to recognize that Pinkaboo worked with us to pre-write and pre-approve all the musician announcement posts. Unfortunately when those marketing pushes did not go well, Marketing was blamed and bared the backlash. Then when Marketing didn't respond fast enough, they were blamed again. This occurred multiple times.
>
> In regards to Musician compensation, we hear reports of all the work Pinkaboo has done to take care of the musician community. One example was letting them stay in her suite so they do not need to pay for their own hotels. That suite, the connecting rooms, and several other rooms, are all paid by BABSCon as part of Concert's budget. Those details of the budget Pinkaboo received, and how she chose to allocate it to the musicians she invited, seem to have been obfuscated from the musicians themselves.
> Do we wish we could pay more for the musicians? Absolutely! The costs to host the concert were already higher than all of the rest of our Panels, Events, Arcade, Tabletop, CCG, Cosplay, and Theatrics budgets all combined, and we worked to stretch it across 50+ musicians as much as we could. We are sorry the details of that were never clearly communicated to the musicians directly.
>
> Internally to staff, there were multiple other situations where statements and allegations Pinkaboo made were, upon review, found to be false.
>
> This leads to the core of the matter â€“ the Chairs have repeatedly seen Pinkaboo twist the truth and serve as an unreliable narrator within our staff team. This issue only grew worse with time, and with three weeks until the convention, it had become an issue we could no longer work around. Part of operating as a team is being able to trust your teammates to accurately and truthfully present information. Pinkaboo lost that trust, and she was removed from staff.

Based on this, what do you think Pinkaboo did?

From my perspective, *I had no freaking idea*, because the first 75% of the statement was trying to
defend against bad things Pinkaboo said, without explicitly saying what those things were? Like, I had
to infer the actions that could lead to these statements, which isn't what a public statement ought to be doing.

Based on what got discussed in the Discord afterwards, here's my best understanding of the situation.

As the music coordinator, Pinkaboo was in charge of convincing brony musicians across the fandom to
attend BABSCon. This typically involves finding crew for AV, drafting contracts, offering free rooms,
promotion, logistics, and so on. Pinkaboo also did not get along with parts of BABSCon staff. There
is no proof of this, but my guess is that Pinkaboo continually argued for a larger and larger share of the
budget to attract talent, and staff did not give her as much as she asked for. As she ramped up criticism for how
BABSCon head of staff was running things, it boiled over until the BABSCon head decided it would be
easier to fire Pinkaboo than deal with her anymore.

The strongest statement I could find re: Pinkaboo's wrongdoings that someone was willing to say publicly
was from a member of con staff saying Pinkaboo's misrepresentation of the state of the concert put
them several weeks behind schedule. To me this sounds most like Pinkaboo forgot some detail or made
an overoptimistic promise, rather than a fireable offense.

In a game of he said she said, what matters the most is trustworthiness. The brony musicians strongly trust
Pinkaboo, and strongly distrust BABSCon staff. Many of them have worked with Pinkaboo before. Many other
*conventions* have worked with Pinkaboo before. And, from a cost-benefit perspective, since BABSCon 2025
was the final BABSCon, if the con head is sick of working with Pinkaboo, they could have just waited 3 weeks
and never interacted with her again.

In short, the burden of proof to justify Pinkaboo's firing is *very* high, and the con staff has failed to
meet it. The closest analogue I can think of is the OpenAI Sam Altman drama, where the board said he was
"not consistently candid with the board", and then never gave a satisfying answer, causing the
company to revolt against them.


The Reaction
------------------------------------------------------------------------


The brony musicians get into an emergency Discord call, and discuss their options.
They decide to form a unified front, and all go on strike, pulling out of the concert. It is 3 weeks until
the convention.

Normally, music artists sign contracts with the con to get agreements on what will be provided, and
these contracts include penalities if they back out of performing. Those penalties should come into
effect now, but after going over their contracts, the musicians argue the contracts were made with
Pinkaboo rather than BABSCon. Now that Pinkaboo is not part of BABSCon, they believe the contracts
no longer hold.

BABSCon staff disagrees, arguing that any common sense interpretation is that the contract implies they
are from Pinkaboo on behalf of BABSCon rather than Pinkaboo individually. This could go to small claims
court, but that wouldn't fix the situation of losing all their music talent, so far as I know the staff
has just agreed to let the contracts go.

Other conventions start tweeting in support of the brony musicians. Some individuals start airing out
dirty laundry and grievances from previous BABSCon iterations, alleging BABSCon has a history of treating
talent poorly. My opinion is basically not moved by this at all.
I assume all conventions have internal drama by default, because logistics is hell and hell is a
pressure cooker. You must make fast decisions with imperfect info to make your con run.
Any longrunning convention will, eventually, ban an innocent person for sexual harassment. That's just
where the bar has to be to create the appropriate environment. So, I'm not surprised that people
have bad things to say about BABSCon, now that it's
publicly acceptable to dunk on them.

A turf war begins in the BABSCon Discord, but it is heavily, heavily biased in favor of the brony
musicians. And, to be clear, I think that was correct based on the available facts. Notably,
even many people on BABSCon staff disagree with the decision. But, they are committed to running the
con, and acknowledging that the BABSCon head has authority.

Con staff and the former BABSCon music lineup go into negotiation, to see if there's any way forward.
The musicians' conditions are:

* Pinkaboo must be reinstated
* BABSCon head of staff must step down

BABSCon staff refuses. Now in my opinion, firing your music lead 3 weeks before con is dumb, but
firing your head of staff 3 weeks before con is just suicidal. There is no way BABSCon was going to
agree to those demands. The strike is on.

However, it does end up being a pretty weak strike. Many of the brony musicians have brony artist
friends, who are relying on selling at the con for their livelihood. Everyone (everypony?) that
is striking is still encouraging people to attend BABSCon. I'm sure they also understand that
the concert is just one evening event of the con, and plenty of convention attendees do not
plan to go to the concert.

Unfortunately for me, I did really want to go to the concert

(then segue into the other parts of this)

The brony music scene is a pretty tight-knit group of people.
Imagine you have a favorite indie rock band, that goes on tour at different venues. Now imagine that
instead of indie rock, it's My Little Pony inspired EDM and metal, and the different venues are My Little Pony conventions.
That's pretty much how it works. One view of conventions is that they let people experience things
they normally wouldn't, and attending a music concert is one of those things. Even if it's actually
held in a hotel meeting room.

Most brony musicians upload their songs to Bandcamp, Soundcloud,
or YouTube. Smaller artists submit to the compilation collective labels, of which the largest is
[Ponies at Dawn](https://poniesatdawn.bandcamp.com). Usually, some of the "big" artists will submit
there too, but it depends on the person. I was less into this scene a while back.
Then I wrote a puzzle about the brony music scene for My Little Pony: Puzzles are Magic, which
required doing a deepdive on the subject, and I came out of it a fan.

The hype of BABSCon 2025 being the last BABSCon made the concert lineup *stacked*. People like
Odyssey and 4everfreebrony go to a bunch of events, but BABSCon also had people who hadn't
performed live in ages, like ponyphonic and Vylet Pony. I was especially hype for Vylet Pony,
because she quickly turned into my favorite brony musician after I found her music, and she
basically never goes to conventions. I got into Vylet's work through 4everfree's cover of
[Little Dreams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA8ZjlPHlaU),
but by far her most famous song
is ANTONYMPH. Its music video (a love letter to the Internet of the late 2000s/early 2010s)
became massively popular and practically spawned its own subfandom on its own.

EMBED HERE

I am partial to the [lyra.horse](https://lyra.horse/antonymph/) version, which pulls some crazy
browser shenanigans and is made by a trans horse infosec researcher. Nothing about that sentence
is surprising if you've spent enough time online.

I don't want this post to turn into the "why you should listen to Vylet Pony post", but the short
version is that her music covers a very wide range of styles and often slaps. My favorite album is
[can opener's notebook: fish whisperer](https://vyletpony.bandcamp.com/album/can-openers-notebook-fish-whisperer)
(yak song my beloved), but I'd also recommend Creature City and Potion Seller from Girls Who Are Wizards,
and PLAY DEAD! PLAY DEAD! and The Wallflower Equation from Monarch of Monsters.
