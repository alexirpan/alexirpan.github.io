This is a really pointless story, but the point of pointless stories is to tell them.

First, some background. Bronies are older fans of My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic.
They are typically teenage age or older,
and predominantly men. At least, that's how it used to be. By 2025, a lot of those
men realized they were transgender, so although the demographics are still mostly male,
it's become more female shifted over time.

Friendship is Magic had a moment in the early 2010s, spawning a bunch of brony conventions.
Many of these cons are now dead, but some still run. The core fan group still attends enough
of them to keep the cons sustainable. At their peak, con attendance would be in the thousands,
but these days attendance in the hundreds is more accurate.

BABSCon is one of those cons. Short for Bay Area Brony Spectacular, it first ran in 2014,
and quickly became one of the mainstays (manestays?) of the brony convention circuit.
My first BABSCon was in 2016, and I've attended most years since. I never did
a great job at making long-lasting friends from these conventions, but they were
fun. For me, cons evolved from "OMG, everything is new and amazing" to "oh, I recognize this
panel and vendor from last year", so pony conventions in general have become less
interesting to me as they became less novel. By the time of BABSCon 2024, I was leaving the
con early with no plans to go to future BABS. I'd gotten my fill, I'd bought all the merch I wanted
to buy, and it just didn't feel worth my time.

Checking social media afterwards, I saw that at closing ceremonies, con
staff announced that next year's BABSCon, BABSCon 2025, would be the *final* BABSCon.
The organization was moving on.

I may have fallen out of the con scene, but *of course* I had to go.


Okay But What Does a My Little Pony Convention Have
-------------------------------------------------------------

MLP conventions follow a similar template.

* Panels, where official MLP voice actors and writers answer questions, or fans present a
pony-adjacent topic.
* Vendor halls and artist alleys, where people sell art prints and fan merch.
* Gaming rooms, where people play video games, board games, or the defunct MLP CCG.
* Parties run out of hotel suites (negotiated with the hotel in advance to satisfy noise
restrictions)
* A music concert in the evenings, typically with EDM or rock music made by brony musicians.

For the final BABSCon, I felt I should give back to the community that had brought so much
entertainment over the years. So on a whim, I filled out a panel application titled
"Ponies and Puzzles".
I pitched a two-part panel. The first would analyze puzzles and riddles in My Little Pony from the
standpoint of puzzle design. The second would present pony-themed puzzles. I explained
why I wanted to run the panel, pointed to academic talks as evidence of my public speaking
experience, and linked [Puzzles are Magic](https://www.puzzlesaremagic.com/),
the MLP-themed puzzlehunt I led the design for back in 2020. This was all to convince
BABSCon that I am the most puzzle-pilled brony in the world and this was the talk I was made to
give, despite never running it before. I figured competition would be high to present at the
final BABSCon.

My panel was accepted! Which left me the task of actually, uh, writing it.
Still, wasn't this what I signed up for?

Three weeks before the official BABSCon date, I get an email from the events coordinator of BABSCon.

> Hello,
>
> If you are receiving this email then you were accepted to be a panelist at BABSCon 2025.
>
> tl;dr I'm hosting open calls to talk about the schedule.

Panelists were expected to attend one of these calls to share their AV requirements and desired time
slots. In particular, if there were events we knew we wanted to attend, they could shuffle the
schedule to make sure our panel wouldn't conflict with those events. Somehow, I've never realized
this is how con scheduling works.

I figured that panel spots would be first-come first-served, so I went to the first time I could
make, the end of the Friday 4-6 PM time slot. I didn't join the call until 5:50 PM, which meant I
was 8th in line. Luckily, the host was willing to run late until they got to everyone.
It was neat to learn a bit about the behind-the-scenes of a pony convention. The first thing I heard
in the call was "Normally I run this panel in a stairwell at night, you guys are the first time I've gotten
to run it officially", so we're off to a great start.

Before they got to me, the host said they had to take a call. Alright, no problem. I go back to tuning
up the slides for my panel. At 6:05 PM, the host comes back saying the situation has evolved into an emergency,
and they'll need to stop the call early. Annoying, but I get that event organizing can be hectic.
I pencil in joining the next open call on Saturday.

Saturday morning arrives. I check my email, and:

> Hi all,
>
> Thank you everyone that came yesterday, I found it very successful and have a much better grasp on panelist needs.
>
> I regret to inform you that due to the ongoing situation I will need to cancel the schedule forum today.
>
> I believe everyone involved tried to do what they thought was best and it is more than unfortunate this conflict came to head in the way it did, when it did.
>
> We are moving forward with what we have, and despite the circumstances, compared to a week ago I am more confident in our ability to pull things off now than I was then. I will wait for an official statement to be decided before speaking on that further.
>
> This in no way affects the evaluation of any panel and I likewise completely understand anyone who needs to cancel. Obviously there may be changes to the schedule in the next few days. I will plan to resume with forum calls on Sunday (tomorrow) and will send an earlier notification than this if the situation changes.

??????

Sorry, what?

I don't read brony social media, so I have no idea what drama is going down. But it's clear that *something* is
going on, it's escalated hard, and it's hit the point where I obviously know what the "ongoing situation" is.
Except I don't. So...what?

With some trepidation, I open the BABSCon Discord, and there is a fire, burning bright.


The Situation
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I've decided not to name anyone besides Pinkaboo, the central figure of the story. The names are easy
to find if you look for them.

Pinkaboo was the music concert coordinator for BABSCon. She has been involved in organizing previous
pony music concerts for several years, for both BABSCon and other pony conventions.
Because of this, she is widely liked by the brony musician community, but not widely known outside
of people who perform at cons, due to playing more of a background role.

General tasks for the music coordinator include finding musicians, convincing them to attend with perks
like free rooms, planning the concert schedule, coordinating AV, coordinating logistics, and so on. Each con
names their concert after a different horse pun. BABSCon's concert is called NEIGHhem.

On Friday 6:18 PM, the musicians get an email saying Pinkaboo was fired from BABSCon. This is 13 minutes
after the "emergency" from the panel call. It's possible the musicians were told earlier, but I believe this
email is the first they hear of it.

> Hello everyone,
> We wanted to inform you directly that the BABSCon Chairs have made the decision to reorganize
> responsibilities over the Neighhem concert. Moving forward, [name] will assume acting responsibility
> as Concert Lead, while we finish interviewing an individual to assume the role full time. Pinkaboo
> is no longer a member of BABSCon staff; her status as a musician remains unchanged.
>
> To be clear, this decision does not impact the existing plans for Neighhem: The set schedule will
> remain as planned. Musician benefits will remains as previously agreed upon, including the gratis
> party suite rooms, which continue to be under Pinkaboo's purview as private guest rooms.
>
> Moving forward, for official convention business, we have created a channel for Concert's exclusive
> use on the BABSCon server, [link]. We can also be reached via email at [email].
>
> As we approach the finish line, we acknowledge Pinkaboo's work building the strong foundation of
> Neighhem at BABSCon. This is a contribution which we will continue to recognize and acknowledge.
>
> Thank you,
> BABSCon Chairs

The brony musicians immediately get into an emergency Discord call with Pinkaboo to get her side
of the story. They quickly decide the BABSCon Chairs are talking out of their ass, do not deserve their respect,
and make a coordinated social media blast announcing they are all dropping out of the concert in
protest.

It is 3 weeks until the convention and one of the major evening activities no longer exists.

This continues blowing up the Discord from Friday into Saturday. The con chairs occasionally reply to
angry people in Discord, but the con itself has not put out an official statement on what happened.
This makes it hard to find exactly why Pinkaboo was fired. A rumor goes around that it
was because Pinkaboo made a passive-aggressive tweet when BABSCon staff tweeted out the
wrong draft of a marketing video for the concert. This was never directly confirmed, and I failed to
find said tweet. If it ever existed, it was deleted before anyone could archive it.

On Saturday night, the BABSCon chairs put out their first statement.

> I do want to apologize for the sudden news that broke yesterday, the ripples it sent throughout the community, and how it affected everyone who has planned on attending BABSCon. Our approach to this situation has been to remain respectful of all parties and refrain from divulging sensitive information; however, this approach has led to misunderstandings and understandable concerns from our staff, guests, and attendees. We would like to shed some clarity on a couple specific situations we have seen being discussed publicly, which are excellent examples of multiple perspectives:
>
> In regards to the concerns with Marketing, we agree Pinkaboo was very engaged with the musicians' unique marketing needs, and extensively pushed to have them promoted. It is important to recognize that Pinkaboo worked with us to pre-write and pre-approve all the musician announcement posts. Unfortunately when those marketing pushes did not go well, Marketing was blamed and bared the backlash. Then when Marketing didn't respond fast enough, they were blamed again. This occurred multiple times.
>
> In regards to Musician compensation, we hear reports of all the work Pinkaboo has done to take care of the musician community. One example was letting them stay in her suite so they do not need to pay for their own hotels. That suite, the connecting rooms, and several other rooms, are all paid by BABSCon as part of Concert's budget. Those details of the budget Pinkaboo received, and how she chose to allocate it to the musicians she invited, seem to have been obfuscated from the musicians themselves.
> Do we wish we could pay more for the musicians? Absolutely! The costs to host the concert were already higher than all of the rest of our Panels, Events, Arcade, Tabletop, CCG, Cosplay, and Theatrics budgets all combined, and we worked to stretch it across 50+ musicians as much as we could. We are sorry the details of that were never clearly communicated to the musicians directly.
>
> Internally to staff, there were multiple other situations where statements and allegations Pinkaboo made were, upon review, found to be false.
>
> This leads to the core of the matter – the Chairs have repeatedly seen Pinkaboo twist the truth and serve as an unreliable narrator within our staff team. This issue only grew worse with time, and with three weeks until the convention, it had become an issue we could no longer work around. Part of operating as a team is being able to trust your teammates to accurately and truthfully present information. Pinkaboo lost that trust, and she was removed from staff.

I'd like to point out how little this actually explains the situation if you had no context,
and how little it explains the firing if you did have context. It's just weird all around.
Saying Pinkaboo was an unreliable narrator without providing examples is like the OpenAI board saying
Sam Altman was not consistently candid. Sure, there's some element of truth, but you have to give
more than that. Similar to that situation, this statement doesn't convince anyone.

Here is my most charitable interpretation, based on a lot of guess work. Pinkaboo did not get along with BABSCon leadership.
I suspect she asked for increasingly large shares of BABSCon money, in the bid to incentivize brony musicians
to make the final BABSCon concert the best one ever. In this, she was **massively** successful,
because the concert lineup is incredibly stacked. There are musicians who have made famous brony songs
but never performed them live. There are musicians who haven't performed in over 5 years. I'd say half the
lineup could be a headliner at an average brony concert. (Yes, there are enough of them for "average brony
concert" to mean something.) Making this happen was likely expensive, and I get the impression Pinkaboo
has more of a begrudging relationship with BABSCon rather than one with constructive criticism. On
Friday, Pinkaboo messed up *something*. Leadership took the opportunity to snowball that mistake into
an excuse to fire her, thinking this would remove a headache from their lives. I've seen this happen before
in professional circles.

Now, as con chairs, they have the authority to fire anybody. No one says they *can't* fire their
music head. Everyone's saying it's dumb they *did*. It's the final BABSCon!
If the chairs are sick of working with Pinkaboo, is working 3 more weeks before never having to work with
her again really so impossible? Let her finish her job, then blame her after the con if the concert goes poorly
and say nothing if it goes well. How is this so hard.

The musicians are pissed off in particular because they know who Pinkaboo is, and are directly aware of the
work she's done to support them. Firing someone from the concert they've been planning for months, *and
then saying they can still perform in it if they want*, is just a crazy level of tone-deafness over what
brony concerts mean to the people performing in them.

This is not lost on the general BABSCon public. In the end, it's all people, but the situation pattern
matches very strongly to the story of a big bad corporation (BABSCon) firing a productive worker (Pinkaboo)
and giving nothing but platitidues for their years of service. And, like most terminally online
fandoms, MLP fans are *very* leftist on average.

<p class="centered">

</p>

In a game of he said she said, what matters is reputation. Pinkaboo has it. The con does not.


Fallout
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Normally, music artists sign contracts with the con to get agreements on what the con will give
the musicians. (For example, Odyssey said she's contractually obligated to
play [Discord](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDMGv3hNMes) at her sets, which - understandable.)
With the musicians on strike, any penalties in those contracts should trigger.
However, on a reread, the musicians argue the contracts were made with Pinkaboo, rather than BABSCon,
so the contracts don't apply to them now that Pinkaboo's been fired.

BABSCon staff disagrees, saying that any common sense interpretation is that the contracts
are from Pinkaboo on behalf of BABSCon, rather than Pinkaboo individually. I take BABSCon's side of this
dispute, but they never pursue this because it doesn't fix the fundamental problem of losing their
music show.

Other conventions start tweeting in support of the brony musicians, with no one taking BABSCon's side.
Some individuals start airing out dirty laundry from previous BABSCon iterations, alleging BABSCon has a history of treating
talent poorly. On reading this, my opinion is basically not moved at all.
I assume all conventions have internal drama by default, because logistics is hell and hell is a
pressure cooker. To make a convention happen, you must make fast decisions with imperfect info.
Any longrunning convention will, eventually, ban an innocent person for sexual harassment, fail to
screen a stalker for a visiting celebrity, or something else. That's just
where the bar has to be to create the appropriate environment. So, I'm not surprised that people
have bad things to say about BABSCon, now that it's publicly acceptable to dunk on them.

Con staff and the former BABSCon musicians go into negotiation, to see if there's any way forward.
The musicians' give their conditions for performing again:

* Pinkaboo must be reinstated as concert head.
* BABSCon head of staff must step down.
* No compromise on either of those points.

BABSCon staff refuses. Now, in my opinion, firing your music lead 3 weeks before con is dumb.
Firing your head of staff 3 weeks before con is just suicidal. As angry as the musicians are about
the concert, they consistently ask people to still attend BABSCon. Many are friends with fan artists
that rely on cons for personal income. Everyone (everypony) still wants the rest of the convention to be great.

Unfortunately for me, the concert really was the main thing I was looking forward to. I was mildly
into brony music pre-2020, and then fell deep, deep into the rabbit hole as a side effect of writing
[Recommendations](https://www.puzzlesaremagic.com/puzzle/recommendations.html) for
Puzzles are Magic. It's hard to me to explain *why* MLP fan music so entertaining, because brony music
is really not accessible. The scene has evolved from "haha mild remix of song from MLP episodes" to
["metal song about Sweetiebot from the Friendship is Witchcraft AU that last updated 10 years ago"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44ugTb3nZec).
That was one of the *bigger* songs of the year. These days an MLP song is likely to have minimal pony
references, only implying a side story that happens to have ponies in it, or have no story at all.

I think the best explanation I have for how this all "works" is that if you're a fan of My Little Pony,
you automatically give some slack to music made by other fans of My Little Pony, because clearly
they have good taste. Then the music recommendation algorithms hijack the existing fandom
social fabric to introduce you to new artists, that all build off each other's work in a small reference
pool. Pretty soon you're radicalized into getting emotional over a song about [a unicorn that rediscovers
her love of music by whispering to fish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-u9O2eG8qQ). Now that's
a story about life.

Imagine you have a favorite indie rock band, that goes on tour at different venues. Now imagine that
instead of indie rock, it's MLP EDM and the venues are hotel meeting rooms. That's pretty much it - a
reason to experience something you normally wouldn't, around an excuse that brings people to the same
spot at the same time.

I like a lot of the artists in the cancelled BABSCon 2025 lineup, but the one I was most looking forward
to was Vylet Pony (the creator of one of the songs linked above). I was introduced to Vylet through
4everfreebrony's cover of [Little Dreams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA8ZjlPHlaU), then went down
the discography from there. Out of her older work, I really like [Overrun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reavAI1hqrM),
but by far her most famous song is ANTONYMPH. Its music video, a love letter to the Internet of the late early 2010s,
was popular enough that it spawned its own subfandom, and you will usually see at least one
Fluttgirshy cosplay at MLP fan conventions.

</p>

I am partial to the [lyra.horse](https://lyra.horse/antonymph/) version, which pulls some crazy
browser shenanigans and is made by a trans horse infosec researcher. Nothing about that sentence
is surprising if you've spent enough time online, which I unfortunately have. In the years since, Vylet
Pony has amassed an eclectic fanbase around the themes of "don't be afraid to like what you like", and
being so unabashed of your inspirations that it circles to being endearing. There is no subtlety
going on: everything is *here* and you gotta take it. In practice, this means I often *really* like
the first half of a Vylet Pony song and then don't get the second, but it also means that when a song
hits on all cylinders for me, it hits very hard.

Vylet Pony also basically never performs at conventions. She was one of the musicians most outspoken
about how she only agreed to perform at BABSCon because she trusted Pinkaboo to keep everything together.
I also suspected she only agreed to BABSCon because she originally grew up in the Bay Area. So my guess was
that this would be the one and only live Vylet Pony performance. And now it's gone.

Well, maybe it's gone.


Asgard Is Not A Place
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All the brony musicians who were going to perform are still flying into Bay Area for the BABSCon weekend.
They've already paid for flights, after all. If everypony's going to be in the same place at the same time,
who says the concert has to be official?

On its face, it is insane to find, plan, and move a concert to an entirely new venue in 3 weeks with no
financial backing. However, is this any more insane than BABSCon trying to replace all their music talent
in 3 weeks against a hostile crowd? Not really, and the musicians are the ones with the most power to
redirect social media outrage.

Real traction begins when 15 comes out of hibernation to offer up to $5000 towards running a new concert.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I&#39;ll pay at least like $5,000 to help secure a new location for the concert if it&#39;s still happening (seriously), I was looking really forward to it 😔 <a href="https://t.co/1gisC5VE0E">https://t.co/1gisC5VE0E</a></p>&mdash; 15 🔜 TrotCon (@fifteenai) <a href="https://twitter.com/fifteenai/status/1905882472845627529?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 29, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

A bit of lore: 15.ai was a site run by an anonymous AI researcher who went by the name 15. They worked on voice generation
before it was cool (aka pre-Transformers). 15.ai let you generate voice clips of My Little Pony characters
saying anything you wanted, for free. In my opinion, when the site launched in 2020, their model was arguably
the highest quality audio generation model in the world. Like, better quality than the models trained by
Google. 15 credited this to the very high quality annotations on MLP speech data by the Pony Preservation
Project from 4chan, which I suspect was the deciding factor over algorithmic improvements. Running 15.ai
was expensive, given how much GPU time it was burning, so giving access for free made them a
celebrity in the fandom - "horse famous", as it were. These days, AI voice generation is a lot more
serious and controversial, but multiple AI voice generation startups credit 15.ai for creating the target
market that they now compete over. (See [the 15.ai Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15.ai)
if you want to learn more.)

15.ai had been dead for years, and 15 themselves is known for being reclusive and going radio silent for
months. Breaking their silence for the BABSCon situation was a big, big deal.

Over the weekend, the idea gained momentum, and soon turned from idea to official project.
Brony musicians began advertising the alternative concert in the BABSCon Discord, calling it "Pinkaboo's Neighhem".
The name is not an accident. It is a proverbial middle finger to their feelings that BABSCon was trying
to silence Pinkaboo's involvement, and a reclaiming of a name that they feel the con no longer owns.

This sparks a bit of infighting in the Discord. BABSCon staff has a lot of volunteers, many of whom disagree
with how Pinkaboo was handled. They are respecting the authority of the con chairs, but aren't necessarily
happy about it. So the reactions range from wanting to shut down all discussion of Pinkaboo's Neighhem,
to advertising it to all attendees. They eventually decide to create a
#neighhem-planning containment channel, and move all discussion there, understanding that it is impossible
to stop people from talking about Pinkaboo. Her story is now woven into the story of BABSCon.

Through a mix of outreach, GoFundMe, and a desire to make everything so far not be for nothing,
Pinkaboo's Neighhem comes together and is officially announced within a few days.

* It will be held on Sunday evening, at the Fox Theatre in downtown Redwood City. This deliberately starts
after BABSCon's scheduled closing ceremony on Sunday afternoon, to avoid competing with the con.
* Neighhem will be free, even for people who didn't register for BABSCon. Donations are welcome to help cover costs.
A limited amount of concert merch will be on sale, along with an artist alley (but not one as big as
BABSCon.)
* The music schedule will be heavily compressed, but most musicians from the original
lineup will still perform, including Vylet Pony.
* Thanks to sponsors, there will be free shuttle buses taking people from the BABSCon hotel to the
Fox Theatre and back.
* Most importantly,

GO TO THE BUCKING CONCERT!

Meanwhile: BABSCon
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BABSCon chairs have successfully pulled together a new official concert, headlined by Mystery Skulls.
This is pretty impressive, since Mystery Skulls is a "real" (i.e. professional) music artist. The
connection to brony fandom is that they own a lot of their popularity to the Mystery Skulls Animated
series by MysteryBen27, an animator from the early 2010s brony scene. Mystery Skulls Animated is good,
it's the kind of series that raises more questions than it answers, with animation where you can notice new
things on your 4th viewing. [Go watch it!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlEb3L1PIco)

Mystery Skulls was scheduled to perform at BABSCon 2020, before it was shut down due to COVID.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Excited to announce I will be performing at <a href="https://twitter.com/BABSCon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@BABSCon</a><br>this year!! <br>go to <a href="https://t.co/k5NeRt6wFc">https://t.co/k5NeRt6wFc</a> to get your badge!

So they already had a working relationship with BABSCon, and as someone connected to but outside of the fandom,
they're not breaking the strike in the same way that a brony musician would. I mean, they are breaking the
strike, but that implies the strikers want to come back. They don't. So, whatever.

With this, a few people point out that against all odds, the situation has led to a better attendee
experience. If you wanted a concert, now you have two concerts. The official BABSCon concert (now called
Burning Mare) is now significantly shorter, and the slack in the schedule is used to move many panels to
larger rooms. My panel benefits from this - I get upgraded from a side room further away from the main hub
to one of the three main panel rooms. There are still hard feelings, but the average con experience
really did get better for people uninvolved. The breakup is bad but the divorce is clean.

When I get to the con, I immediately line up for the con store, because I'm pretty confident they will run out
of some items by tomorrow. I come out with a BABSCon 2025 T-shirt and a coin from leftover BABSCon 2024 merch.
The T-shirts run out by Friday, my call was correct. I pick up a printed out conbook, and perhaps it's
just my imagination, but the page advertising Mystery Skulls feels like noticably different paperstock.

There isn't too much to comment on for the rest of the con. As I said, I've been to enough of these to know what
to expect, and when I walk into the vendor hall, I don't even want to buy that many things, because I recognize
the faces of at least 2/3rds of the vendors from previous pony conventions. I end up buying some prints from
one of the MLP comics artists that's attending BABS for the first and final time, and some tiny wood burned
pony arts that were 25 cents each at a gacha setup. The one thing I'm surprised to not see are resellers
of the Kayou MLP cards that are popular in China. I figured at least one vendor would be trying to doing to
some arbitrage with them.

When it gets close to the time for my panel, I head to the room. I'm not sure if I set it up myself or if someone
from the con will help organize. When no one else comes for a bit, I set it up myself. From my standpoint, the panel
goes well. I have to live-debug fixing computer audio in the middle,
but people are engaged the whole time and have good follow-up questions about puzzle design at the end. We get through
the [Power](https://deusovi.github.io/puzzlefiles/zelda-minihunt.pdf) puzzle
from Deusovi's Zelda Minihunt, a runthrough of [Art of the Dress](https://www.puzzlesaremagic.com/puzzle/art-of-the-dress.html) from
Puzzles are Magic, and get partway through a group solve of [Cross Eyed](https://www.puzzlesaremagic.com/puzzle/cross-eyed.html)
in overtime before the next panel takes the stage.

The food is predictably overpriced, and the gaming area is predictably fun. One of my favorite BABSCon memories is
playing 3 hours of Smash 64 against someone continuously salting about how bullshit Kirby is while wearing Trixie cosplay.
Unfortunately, the gaming demographics have shifted heavily to Smash Ultimate and a little bit of Them's Fightin' Herds, neither of
which I got that into. The panels are fun. One that is a livecasting of a modded WWE game, changing all the
wrestlers to look like MLP characters. Another goes through a leaked internal Hasbro document circa 2013, that analyzed
brony fandom and culture for the purposes of helping their marketing teams decide what to do about it.

At the British themed room party, I meet one of the organizers of
[PonyCon Holland](https://ponyconholland.com/), who complains that me going to London doesn't count as visiting the UK.
I ask what would count - he says "anywhere but London". We talk a bit about pony cons outside the US, and the
recent explosion of the Chinese bronycon scene. I don't follow Chinese brony fandom much, but have
learned some slang like 虹林檎 and 稀有苹果. My Little Pony is massive over there; it feels like China
is 10 years behind the US, and they are living through the 2015-2016 peak of MLP popularity, with new conventions
appearing every year. In the US, this was followed by a contraction, as the less well run cons died off.
Hopefully that doesn't happen to the Chinese scene, but it'll depend how much staying power MLP has.
Someone there speculates that Hasbro will prepare a marketing push for the Year of the Horse in 2026. We'll see.

The final BABSCon wraps up with its charity auction, which I am quickly priced out of. The charity auction does go
over time, so as closing ceremonies begin, a few people start boarding the shuttles that have arrived for Pinkaboo's
Neighhem. I am not enough of a hater or pony music person to skip the literal final BABSCon closing ceremony,
but it does have an odd sense of not-quite-finality to it. A *lot* of people are going to Pinkaboo's Neighhem.

To borrow a saying from the youth, the vibes are immaculate.

The entire concert is an after party, complete with a custom drinks menu at the bar. According to
the organizers, they got over 1000 signups on their Eventbrite. It's not clear how many of those people showed
up in person, but I'd say about half the convention has shown up. Pretty good turnout for a
relatively last minute event, especially given that some people are flying out on Sunday evening.

The venue is
fancier. And the concert setup is significantly more elaborate, with a larger stage and more audiovisual setup.
It turns out you *can* just move a concert if everyone (everypony) involved decides to transplant
their existing work.

I stick around until the schedule gets to an act I think I can skip, and get dinner at a ramen place.
As I walk back to the venue, boba in hand, security stops me and tells me no outside drinks are allowed.
So I drink my boba outside, suddenly feeling a bit self-conscious about wearing an MLP hoodie and jersey
in public. I remember a comment from a Youtube video essay about ANTONYMPH:

> When I wore my fursuit on my college campus for Halloween I had many peers who thought they were a spectator to the cringe show that I was, and they’d record me or look and talk about me from far away in their groups- unaware of how good my head’s visibility is. When I noticed someone recording or jeering, I waved and I posed, and they’d either immediately look away or act like it was not me they were recording. They didn’t realize the show was interactive! We have this kind of drive to cringe at and feel better than others, assuming they are static and detached from us, but in reality (especially as we see it now) the “other” might be starkly aware of you.

In the crowd outside, I spot someone who I remember gave a talk about MLP generative AI at a previous
BABSCon, and I say hi. In retrospect, I realize I did not introduce myself at all, and, oops that
made things awkward. We briefly talk about rationalists - it turns out you cannot escape rationalist
discussion if you are in the Bay Area and talk about AI, even outside of a My Little Pony
concert.

I go back into the concert area, picking up a poster since T-shirts in my size are sold out. By the end
of the night, Neighhem will have sold literally all merch they made.
I alternate between the dance floor area and the cool-down balcony on the top floor.

Midway through one of the sets, there's a medical emergency, where someone falls down and dislocates their
knee. EMTs are on-site, and organizers stop the set to allow the medical professionals to attend to them.
As far as I know, the person who fell was just clumsy and got too excited, but out of an abundance of caution
the bar cuts off alcohol for the night. (Which unfortunately means I never get to try "The Pinkaboo"
or "The Eurobeat Brony" cocktails.)

Concert staff release balloons into the crowd, and for the next few hours, there is a longstanding minigame
of "keep the balloon in the air". People start filing out as the concert runs later, but I am committed to
seeing the Vylet and Odyssey sets, which are running back-to-back from midnight to 2 AM.

The Vylet set doesn't include anything from Monarch of Monsters, but I wasn't really expecting it to -
it's not a particularly good "dancing" album and the subject matter is heavy. I am happy to recognize some
songs from Paradise Valley, as well as [Creature City](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJr-_KWPRNc),
one of my songs of the year from 2024. Based on the volume of the cheers, it is very obvious that
Vylet's post-2020 work is more well-known, but I catch some references to Super Pony World. Of course,
ANTONYMPH gets the loudest cheers, but the song truly is fire.

Odyssey goes up, and like always her stage presence is enormous. When it gets to Luna and Discord,
the crowd shouts out the lyrics, because yes, here everyone knows the lyrics by heart. Part of me wonders
how much Odyssey likes playing songs from over a decade ago, compared to her new work, but those are the
songs that pay the bills, cultural touchstones in a fandom that's been buffeted and weathered but somehow
never quite died. BABSCon is over for good, but the people are still here.

The BABSCon Discord is now mostly dormant, having turned into yet another MLP chatting Discord but with
a Bay Area lean.

The musicians go back from whence they came. Some are still active in the MLP music scene, while others
have either stopped making music or work professionally under other aliases. Vylet Pony releases her
new album [Love & Ponystep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKpsl3tJmIU) in July. It's a banger. So far,
"Wonka x Howl" is my favorite.

The Pinkaboo Neighhem Discord is similar, acting as another MLP music Discord. Several months later,
Pinkaboo announces that after paying musicians and staff their fees, Neighhem had $1500 left over, which
was donated to the music program at [New Horizon School](https://www.newhorizonschool.info/), a school for
students with learning disabilities.

And in the distance is a rumbling of hoofsteps.
