The point of pointless stories is to tell them.

First, some background. Bronies are older fans of My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic,
typically teenager age or older, predominantly male. At least that's how it used to be,
the ratios have shifted to be more female over time. It had a moment in the early 2010s,
spawning a bunch of MLP fan conventions, or brony conventions. Many of these cons are now
dead, but some still run, and the dedicated core fan community still attends enough of them
to keep it sustainable. At their peak, attendance would be in the thousands. These days
it's around 200-800.

BABSCon, short for Bay Area Brony Spectacular, was one such event. They first ran in 2014,
and quickly became one of the mainstays (manestays?) of the brony convention circuit.
My first BABSCon was in 2016, and I attended most years ever since. I never did
a great job at actually making long-lasting friends from these conventions, but they were
fun. For me, they evolved from "OMG, everything is new and amazing" to "oh, I recognize
this vendor from last year, and I've been to this panel before, and I've heard this
story before", and so on. As I left BABSCon 2024, I decided I was no longer attending BABSCon.
I'd gotten my fill, I was running out of merch I wanted to buy, and it just didn't
feel worth my time anymore.

Then at closing ceremonies, they announced that BABSCon 2025 would be the *final* BABSCon.
The organizing staff wanted to move on. I may have fallen out of the con scene, but
*of course* I had to go.

What transpired turned into an almost perfect cross-section of my life. And we haven't even
gotten to the music yet.

A brony convention can very broadly be sliced into these pieces:

* Panels, where official MLP voice actors and writers answer questions, or fans present a
pony-adjacent topic.
* Vendor halls and artist alleys, where fans sell art prints and fan merch.
* Gaming rooms (with board gaming, video gaming, and card gaming all represented).
* A concert area in the evenings.

For the final BABSCon, I felt I should give back the community that had brought so much
entertainment and joy to me over the years. On a whim, I filled out a panel application titled
"Ponies and Puzzles". In it, I pitched a two-part panel. The first would cover puzzle
design, and rank the puzzles and riddles which appeared in My Little Pony. (There are
a surprisingly large number of these, since the show has homaged both detective fiction
and adventure fiction.) The second would be an introduction to puzzlehunts. I explained why
I wanted to run this panel, pointed to academic talks I'd given before as evidence of
public speaking experience, and linked [Puzzles are Magic](https://www.puzzlesaremagic.com/),
the MLP-themed puzzlehunt I led the design for back in 2020. I am the most puzzle-pilled
brony in the world, this is the talk I was made for.

The panel was accepted! Which left me the task of preparing a 90 minute talk. Oops. Still,
wasn't this what I signed up for? As I worked on sourcing episode clips and deciding what to
keep and what to cut, I got an email from the events coordinator of BABSCon.

> Hello,
>
> If you are receiving this email then you were accepted to be a panelist at BABSCon 2025.
>
> tl;dr I'm hosting open calls to talk about the schedule.

Panelists were expected to attend one of the open calls, to discuss their audiovisual (AV) requirements,
desired time slots, room constraints, and so on. The way it worked was that the events coordinator
would host a Zoom call, panelists would drop in whenever they were free, and would be called on in
order to chat for 2-5 minutes to find what time worked for them. Figuring that panel slots would be
taken in a first-come first-served basis, I went to the first one I could make, the tail-end of the
Friday evening timeslot. By the time I got in the call, I was around 8th in line. The first thing I heard
was "I normally host this panel under a stairway, since I haven't gotten to run it officially yet",
so we were off to a great start.

When I was 3rd in line, the host said they had to take a call. Alright, no problem. They then said
that the situation had evolved into an emergency, and they'd need to cut the call early. Unfortunate,
but understandable. The next open call would be tomorrow, on Saturday.

On Saturday morning, I see the following email.

> Hi all,
>
> Thank you everyone that came yesterday, I found it very successful and have a much better grasp on panelist needs.
>
> I regret to inform you that due to the ongoing situation I will need to cancel the schedule forum today. 
>
> I believe everyone involved tried to do what they thought was best and it is more than unfortunate this conflict came to head in the way it did, when it did. 
>
> We are moving forward with what we have, and despite the circumstances, compared to a week ago I am more confident in our ability to pull things off now than I was then. I will wait for an official statement to be decided before speaking on that further.
>
> This in no way affects the evaluation of any panel and I likewise completely understand anyone who needs to cancel. Obviously there may be changes to the schedule in the next few days. I will plan to resume with forum calls on Sunday (tomorrow) and will send an earlier notification than this if the situation changes.

I have **no idea** what this is referencing. All I know is that there is drama and it's escalated *hard*.
I am not on Pony Twitter (because I'm not on Twitter in general), but I am in the BABSCon Discord. So
I open it for the first time in a long while.


The Strike
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hm...how do I explain this.

The brony music scene is a pretty tight-knit group of people.
Imagine you have a favorite indie rock band, that goes on tour at different venues. Now imagine that
instead of indie rock, it's My Little Pony inspired EDM and metal, and the different venues are My Little Pony conventions.
That's pretty much how it works. One view of conventions is that they let people experience things
they normally wouldn't, and attending a music concert is one of those things. Even if it's actually
held in a hotel meeting room.

Most brony musicians upload their songs to Bandcamp, Soundcloud,
or YouTube. Smaller artists submit to the compilation collective labels, of which the largest is
[Ponies at Dawn](https://poniesatdawn.bandcamp.com). Usually, some of the "big" artists will submit
there too, but it depends on the person. I was less into this scene a while back.
Then I wrote a puzzle about the brony music scene for My Little Pony: Puzzles are Magic, which
required doing a deepdive on the subject, and I came out of it a fan.

The hype of BABSCon 2025 being the last BABSCon made the concert lineup *stacked*. People like
Odyssey and 4everfreebrony go to a bunch of events, but BABSCon also had people who hadn't
performed live in ages, like ponyphonic and Vylet Pony. I was especially hype for Vylet Pony,
because she quickly turned into my favorite brony musician after I found her music, and she
basically never goes to conventions. I got into Vylet's work through 4everfree's cover of
[Little Dreams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA8ZjlPHlaU),
but by far her most famous song
is ANTONYMPH. Its music video (a love letter to the Internet of the late 2000s/early 2010s)
became massively popular and practically spawned its own subfandom on its own.

EMBED HERE

I am partial to the [lyra.horse](https://lyra.horse/antonymph/) version, which pulls some crazy
browser shenanigans and is made by a trans horse infosec researcher. Nothing about that sentence
is surprising if you've spent enough time online.

I don't want this post to turn into the "why you should listen to Vylet Pony post", but the short
version is that her music covers a very wide range of styles and often slaps. My favorite album is
[can opener's notebook: fish whisperer](https://vyletpony.bandcamp.com/album/can-openers-notebook-fish-whisperer)
(yak song my beloved), but I'd also recommend Creature City and Potion Seller from Girls Who Are Wizards,
and PLAY DEAD! PLAY DEAD! and The Wallflower Equation from Monarch of Monsters.
