Neopets is under new management, who's trying to start a Neopets Renaissance. They've brought back Flash games, thanks to Ruffle, a Flash emulator written in Rust. New content is coming out, with an acknowledgement that the playerbase is mostly nostalgic adults rather than new kids. These days the typical Neopets user is a mid 20s woman with 60% odds of being LGBT - see this [unofficial demographics survey](https://www.reddit.com/r/neopets/comments/zft93c/neopets_user_base_demographics_survey_results/) for more.

I have slightly mixed feelings, in that I like Neopets as a time capsule of the early 2000s Internet. I suppose expecting to stay the same forever was never a realistic assumption.
Of the people coming back, many arrive at the same question: how do I afford anything?

**Buddy do I have the deal for you!**

You know how much time I have spent studying how to squeeze Neopoints water out of the Neopets stone? WAY TOO MUCH TIME. Like really it's too much. I should stop.

Part of your duty to humanity is that if you spend a bunch of time learning something, you should try to write it up so that other people don' tt have to go through the same struggle. Yes, even if it's about something that's as silly as Neopets.

I have tried to  organize this from most to least important. Thereare a lot of actions in the site thata are technically positive expected value, but which are really not worth the time.

Daily Quests

Let's start with th enew kid on the block. These are super new, just 2 weeks old at time of writing.

Neopets has an inflation problem. For various reasons, money doesn't leave the Neopets ecosystem as fast as it shoul. It's not a total disaster, but
(this Reddit user) has done some great analysis of prices based on the JellyNeo database and has found that paintbrushes inflat by 7% year over year. (Find the link).
This has led to a bit of rich vs poor dynamic, where there are a ton of status symbols and a bunch are unattainable unless you spend many many hours learning to play the Neopets market.

Daily quests are thea firing shot against the inflation problem.

You do abunch of tiny tasks, like "play a game" or "feed a pet" and you get a small reward, sometimes wpure NP and sometimes a token item. Doing all 5 dailies gets you 30k NP, and doing dailies 7 days in a row gets you the weekly reward.

The weekly reward is the thing that makes daily quests so appealing.. Wjem TNT launched the weekly pool, they aimed SUPER HIGH on the item pool. The weekly reward I had when they launched was a book that had market price of 40 million.

Or rather, I should say it used to be 40 million, by the time I got it they were selling for only around 400k. This is TNT's direct shot against item inflation. A large set of items are expensive because of scarcity rather than demand. Not that there's zero demand, just that the demand is small but  supply is even smaller.

It's unclear where exactly the prices of weekly reawrd items will land, but right now I'd estimate it averages as about 50k-100k NP per day averaged over the entire item pool if you get to the weekly reward every day.

Food Club

We move to the exact oposite of Daily Quests. Daily Quersts were created right now, to directly combat inflation, via a daily system straight out of a mobile gaming playbook to increase retention.

Food Club is a dumb system made 20 years made 20 years ago, with no long term planning, and is now the major source of inflation on its own.

I'm getting ahead of myself. How does this work?

Think of food club as like horse racing. it's like horse racing. There are 5 arenas, where 4 pirates compete in each for who can eat the most food. There is some hidden formula defining win rate that I'm sure you could derive from data if you wanted to, but, in general, you can assume the odds for a pirate corresponds to its win probabilitiy.
A 4:1 pirate will have a win rate of about 25% and on average, betting on them will neither win nor lose Neopoints.

However, Neopets does something weird. The payout for a Pirate is always rounded to the nearest integer, cannot go lower than 2:1, and cannot go higher to 13:1. So, suppose you have an arena like this:

2:1
8:1
10:1
13:1

We know that (math goes here). The end result is that, the 2:1 pirate has win probability much higher than 50%.

Food club allows you to make 10 bets, and strategy corresponds to identifying these positive expected value pirates, and exploiting them as much as possible. There are varied strategies for how to do this, but typical strategies average a 70%-90% profit on average. If you don't want to learn strategy, there are plenty of "Food Club influencers" who publicly post their
bets each day, and you can just copy one of them.

The maximum bet size you can make is 50, pluse 2 for every day your account has been on Neopets. Who knows why they picked this?Now, suppoose that many accounts on Neopets are over 15 years old, such that people can regularly make 10k+ sized bets. At 10 bets per day, this gets you to 40k-90k of profit a day.

This is a pretty insane amount of money, because it's pure NP. It's not driven by the market price of items. It's just, money flowing into the economy.
It's also incredibly easy to automate. u/neo_truths is a grey had hacker who has access to Neopets source code, and oaccsionally does deep dives into Neopets database logs. They've disclosed that there is a Food Club botter,.
Using one of the (many) Neopets data breaches, they've built a bot net of several thousand Neopets users, using old abandoned accounts, then had them all play Food Club.

It's a real problem, but I'm not sure TNT has an easy way pout of it. Food Club is basically the recommended NP making tool for anyone who comes back to the site, and
I think there'd be riots if they got rid of it. For now, go bet on those pirates.

Trudy's Surprise

This feature was added a few years ago, and is basically a pure NP giveeaway. Like other dailies released recently, it rewards frequent play. If you visit Trudy's Surprise every day, you are guaranteed to get a 100k payout on day 25. Even before then, you get around 16k per day at minimum once you get to the 7 day streak. See JellyNeo's table.

Wishing Well

We now get into the more pure gambling aspects of the site.

The Wishing Well is a place where you can toos in Neopeoints and wish for a specific item. All items of rarity below (XX) are allowed, and you can make 14 swishes per day (7 in the morning and 6 in the evening). Each wish costs 21 NP and throwing in more doesn't affect the odds at all.

Each day the well picks 240 winners. The winning item

What makes the wishing well profitable is that the most expensive rarity XX item is usuallly way, way more epensive than the wishing cost. In the past teh cost of such items was around 300k. Now the most expensive items are around 1 million. You can usually find what to wish for by seeing whats most common in the winner list from yesterday.

Given that it only costs 140 NP a day, you only need a 1 in 3000 (CHECK MATH)) chance of winning to make this worth it. What are your true odds of winning?
Well, I haven't done the math or stats tracking, but at current user activity, I usually win a few times per year.

This is naturally something that will get less profitable wiif more peopel know about it, and I have genuinelye considered not mentioning it, but I figure the effect isn't that big a deal and I have enough NP that I don't mind telling the secret.
(It's not even much of a secret anyways.)

Assuming a hit rate of 2 prizes per year, this averages out to TODO profit per day on average. Expect to get less profit if you're trying to quick-sell items to convert them into pure cash (Neopoints) though.

Battledome

Ah, the Battledome. You play long enough, you end up with one high-end outlet. For me that was the Battledome. Top tier items can literally extend up to over a billion Neopoints.

The Battledome went through a revamp in XXXX, which diehard fans usually don't like because it both removed HP increase and introduced a bunch of broken abilities that need to be banned in competitive play for balance purposes. However, it did introduce a new way to get rewards from fighting CPU opponents - that's what we're focusing on here.

The exact mechanics and drop rates from challengers is not fully known, but here's what is known. There is a global pool of items, that all challengers drop. That pool depends on the
arena a challenger is in. There's a challenger specific pool, which gets added to that pool. The drop rates vary but it appears that certain arenas are more likely to drop from the global pool than other ones. (Link the reddit post here.)

(Link the neo truths post here too)

The only valuable items in the global pool are codestones, the currency used for battledome training. The Water Dome also drops dubloons, which can also be used for training but are pretty marginal. **Most** challenger specific pools do not have good items, so the recommendation is usually to fight

* Koi Warrior, any difficulty
* Giant Mutant Spectral Walrein, medium difficulty

since they have the smallest pool of specific items and therefore are most likely to give codestones. However, on occasion it's worth fighting other challengers for their specific drops.

* The Kreludor Robot, which rarely drops Armored Neggs. Those Neggs are a stat
boosting item and often sell for a lot. The Kreludor Robot is also one of the easiest
challengers in the battledome and is a common "starter" challenger to fight
while training for tougher ones.
* The premium challengers (Space Faerie, CHECK), which are only available to
Neopets premium users, but which drop Nerkmids and Giant Bubbling Space Fungus, both valuable items.
The first can be gambled for paint brushes at the Alien Vending Machine, and the
latter is a stat-boosting item for Battledome trainers.
* The Snowager, which is by far strongest enemy you could fight, but which has a
small chance of dropping Frozen Neggs. These can be directed traded for Negg points,
which essentially makes them as valuable as the most expensive Negg. The most
expensive Negg is usally the Snegg, since top 1% rich Neopians compete on who
can get the most HP, and Sneggs are one of the few effective ways to do so if
money is no object.

The profit depends on market prices of the items, but on average,

Snowager > Premium Challengers > Walrein > Koi Warrior > Kreludor

This, coincidentally, is also the order of difficulty for how hard they are to fight.

Fighting the Snowager is the highest variance, since your profit is all based on
Frozen Negg drops. You get 15 item drops per day, and based on stats, you can
expect to see around 10 Frozen Neggs per **month**. But right now, Frozen Neggs
cost 450k. Assuming you can sell for that much, it should average 150k NP per day,
and this is ignoring the random Codestone drops along the way.

If you can't beat the Snowager, and don't pay for premium, you can still get NP from
Codestone drops. Codestone prices change but right now (put in the math here) and
you can expect to get N codestones a day.

Unfortunately you'll need to train a Neopet for several months to get to the point
of fighting the Snowager. Training a Neopet takes a lot of time and money (see Codestone
prices above), but if you want to train for other reasons, you might as well set a goal
of getting to the Snowager tier. I recommend using the "rush to level 250" strategy
described here. It has more set-up time but is more efficient at getting to max stats
in both time and money.

The Stock Market

Ahh, the stock market. According to legend, stock prices used to be driven by user behavior.
Then some users coordinated a stock pump and dump, so it got changed to be entirely random.
This doesn't stop people from posting "to the mooooon", especially during the Gamestop
craze of 2020.

Each day, you can buy up to 1000 shares of stock. You're only allowed to buy stock that's
15 NP/share (or 10 NP/share if you have the Battleground boon - more on that later).
You can sell as much stock as you want,
paying a 20 NP commission per transaction. (In practice this commission is basically zero
and I'll be treating it as such.)

If stock motion is entirely random, how can you make money? You can think of stock prices
like a random walk. Sometimes they drift up, sometimes they drift down, but average motion
is zero. However, you only realize gains or losses at the time you sell.
So you simply hold all the stocks that go down, and sell the lucky stocks that go up.
Every stock will *eventually* cross into profitable territory, it just might take a while.

The common advice is to set a sell threshold (common recommendations are 30 NP/share, 45 NP/share,
and 60 NP/share depending on patience), and sell whenever the stock crosses that price. Generally I would
recommend
