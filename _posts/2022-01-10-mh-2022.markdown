*This has spoilers for MIT Mystery Hunt 2022. Spoilers are interspersed and will
not be labeled ahead of time.*

So, teammate won Mystery Hunt.

Since the winner of MIT Mystery Hunt has to write the next year's hunt, things will
be...*interesting* for the next year. I still need to decide what level of involvement
I'll have in that, but to be safe this post isn't going to do any speculation about the
future of Hunt.

This year was the first year where teammate didn't do open signups. In previous years,
teammate was around 60-80 people, and based on a team survey after Mystery Hunt 2021,
people generally felt the team was growing too big. So, for 2022, the team was limited
to dedicated team members, which was defined as people who helped write Teammate Hunt,
or had hunted with teammate in 2021 and at least one previous year. I think this is
always a tricky thing to navigate, since the natural state of hunt teams is to grow larger
over time, and people will always end up close to whatever line you draw.

That means this year, we fielded 53 people, which puts us around the size of Left Out.
And this year was *really* close. Left Out was basically tied with us all through Saturday,
and Death & Mayhem was ahead of us until they slowed down around Sunday 4 AM.
(We...kept going.)

I don't think we made any big changes from last year with regards to
Sheets norms or remote solving tools.
Based on what Wei-Hwa said in the afterparty Discord, I think the reason teammate edged
out Left Out was that we were more gung ho about going for the win, whereas Left Out
was more uncertain and didn't decide to fully go for it until the end. More specifically,
Left Out saved all 3 free answers until they were sure about things, hammering them all
on Sci-Ficisco. We had used one free answer in New You City (on a puzzle that had been
open for a while with no progress), and two free answers in Howtoona, based on our
observation that after we solved the meta, it would be pretty easy to backsolve the rest of
the round and quickly unlock everything in Sci-Fi. That likely sped up our meta solves /
let us make up for our slightly slower puzzle solving average.

I'm not sure how this compares to other teams, but teammate has always had a decent number
of people who *really* like the meta-level strategizing of how to get from the start of
Hunt to the end as effectively as possible, and team policy has always been that it's
okay to hunt this way. This means that, for example, you never need to ask permission to
backsolve, and every year we've had a puzzle that got sniped from someone who was about
to finish their forward solve. Depending on viewpoint, this is either fine or horrifying.
But, well, it does *work*, and there's some fun in figuring out the right speedrun route.


Thoughts on Hunt
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Good hunt.

Fun theming, many puns, solid puzzles, and cool that there was an intermediate tier of accomplishment between
the first round and Pen Station. I would have preferred the team interactions to not be
recorded ahead of time, since I felt that made it easier to skip the story, but I realize that
it's logistically a lot harder to make that happen.

So still. Good hunt.


Pre-Hunt
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our pre-hunt socials were mostly different groups of 2-4 people doing independent Star
Rats solves, and despite doing this many times, I think literally every group backsolved
The Rescuers. This probably says something about what puzzles we tend to start working on
first. We also played some [escape room games](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1435790/Escape_Simulator/) and other board games.

Like last year, we had a #conspiracies Discord channel, where I claimed that it would be
important that MLK day was a full moon (it wasn't), but a [Scriptnotes](https://johnaugust.com/2021/scriptnotes-episode-485-unions-and-guilds-transcript)
episode we found seemed too good to be true. It mentioned puzzles, and palindromes, and
"anagrams of MATE", and a tweet made on January 17, which was MLK day this year.
Based on that and the mention of crossword alignment charts, it really seemed like it
was seeding puzzle content. It wasn't, and in retrospect, the date of the podcast
(2 weeks after winning Hunt) should have been a sign that it probably wasn't important.

For this hunt, we did three optional in-person hubs, with one in Bay Area,
one in Seattle, and one in Boston. This was a bit risky, but I went to the Bay Area one
since I felt it was within my risk tolerance. No
one was flying in, everyone attending had gotten a booster, masks required, it was in
South Bay where people generally take COVID pretty seriously, and you had to show a
negative rapid test day of. I'm actually not sure how much the in-person hub helped solving,
aside from the two physical puzzles I worked on, but it definitely helped then.

I had been working through the Ace Attorney series prior to Hunt. Right now, I'm on
the 2nd case of Apollo Justice, which features a noodle shop called Eldoon's Noodles.
The characters say it's an almost-palindrome in game, and even talk about "Team Meat"
when you inspect the evidence. A pretty eerie coincidence.

The Investigation
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**The Missing Piece** - First puzzle I worked on in Hunt. I recognized the Palindrome name badge
theming right away (although that isn't a big deal for the puzzle). During the solve process,
I looked up past Palindrome name badges, and found the 2009 Star Rats badge, which was a bit
of a trip, but I figured there was no way Palindrome would make a puzzle in the first round
depend on previous real-world badges. We never figured out what the years meant - after we
counted the lanyard overlaps, we were pretty sure that was correct and figured we had skipped
a step somewhere (but in reality the years were just an extra check if you ever tried sorting
the badges by alpha).

**Where the Wild Things Are** - This was the first physical puzzle, and mostly got claimed by the
Boston Hub, but the Bay Area group claimed the jigsaw puzzle - which ended up being one of the
longer ones. With no patterned edges, pairing pieces up was pretty tough. We figured out all of the
mechanics, but our data was incomplete and the meta got solved before we could patch it up.
