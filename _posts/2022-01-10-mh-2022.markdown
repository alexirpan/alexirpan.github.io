*This has spoilers for MIT Mystery Hunt 2022. Spoilers are interspersed and will
not be labeled ahead of time.*

So, teammate won Mystery Hunt.

Since the winner of MIT Mystery Hunt has to write the next year's hunt, things will
be...*interesting* for the next year. I still need to decide what level of involvement
I'll have in that, but to be safe this post isn't going to do any speculation about the
future of Hunt.

This year was the first year where teammate didn't do open signups. In previous years,
teammate was around 60-80 people, and based on a team survey after Mystery Hunt 2021,
people generally felt the team was growing too big. So, for 2022, the team was limited
to dedicated team members, which was defined as people who helped write Teammate Hunt,
or had hunted with teammate in 2021 and at least one previous year. I think this is
always a tricky thing to navigate, since the natural state of hunt teams is to grow larger
over time, and people will always end up close to whatever line you draw.

That means this year, we fielded 53 people, which puts us around the size of Left Out.
And this year was *really* close. Left Out was basically tied with us all through Saturday,
and Death & Mayhem was ahead of us until they slowed down around Sunday 4 AM.
(We...kept going.)

I don't think we made any big changes from last year with regards to
Sheets norms or remote solving tools.
Based on what Wei-Hwa said in the afterparty Discord, I think the reason teammate edged
out Left Out was that we were more gung ho about going for the win, whereas Left Out
was more uncertain and didn't decide to fully go for it until the end. More specifically,
Left Out saved all 3 free answers until they were sure about things, hammering them all
on Sci-Ficisco. We had used one free answer in New You City (on a puzzle that had been
open for a while with no progress), and two free answers in Howtoona, based on our
observation that after we solved the meta, it would be pretty easy to backsolve the rest of
the round and quickly unlock everything in Sci-Fi. That likely sped up our meta solves /
let us make up for our slightly slower puzzle solving average.

I'm not sure how this compares to other teams, but teammate has always had a decent number
of people who *really* like the meta-level strategizing of how to get from the start of
Hunt to the end as effectively as possible, and team policy has always been that it's
okay to hunt this way. This means that, for example, you never need to ask permission to
backsolve, and every year we've had a puzzle that got sniped from someone who was about
to finish their forward solve. Depending on viewpoint, this is either fine or horrifying.
But, well, it does *work*, and it can be fun to improvise a good speedrun route.


Thoughts on Hunt
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Good hunt.

Fun theming, many puns, solid puzzles, good art, and cool that there was an intermediate tier of accomplishment between
the first round and Pen Station. I would have preferred the team interactions to not be
recorded ahead of time, since I felt that made it easier to skip the story, but I realize that
it's logistically a lot harder to make that happen.

So still. Good hunt.


Pre-Hunt
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our pre-hunt socials were mostly different groups of 2-4 people doing independent Star
Rats solves, and despite doing this many times, I think literally every group backsolved
The Rescuers. This probably says something about what puzzles we tend to start working on
first. We also played some [escape room games](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1435790/Escape_Simulator/) and other board games.

Like last year, we had a #conspiracies Discord channel, where I claimed that it would be
important that MLK day was a full moon (it wasn't), but a [Scriptnotes](https://johnaugust.com/2021/scriptnotes-episode-485-unions-and-guilds-transcript)
episode we found seemed too good to be true. It mentioned puzzles, and palindromes, and
"anagrams of MATE", and a tweet made on January 17, which was MLK day this year.
Based on that and the mention of crossword alignment charts, it really seemed like it
was seeding puzzle content. It wasn't, and in retrospect, the date of the podcast
(2 weeks after winning Hunt) should have been a sign that it probably wasn't important.

For this hunt, we did three optional in-person hubs, with one in Bay Area,
one in Seattle, and one in Boston. This was a bit risky, but I went to the Bay Area one
since I felt it was within my risk tolerance. No
one was flying in, everyone attending had gotten a booster, masks required, it was in
South Bay where people generally take COVID pretty seriously, and you had to show a
negative rapid test day of. I'm actually not sure how much the in-person hub helped solving,
aside from the two physical puzzles I worked on, but it definitely helped then.

I had been working through the Ace Attorney series prior to Hunt. Right now, I'm on
the 2nd case of Apollo Justice, which features a noodle shop called Eldoon's Noodles.
The characters say it's an almost-palindrome in game, and even talk about "Team Meat"
when you inspect the evidence. A pretty eerie coincidence.

The Investigation
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**The Missing Piece** - First puzzle I worked on in Hunt. I recognized the Palindrome name badge
theming right away (although that isn't a big deal for the puzzle). During the solve process,
I looked up past Palindrome name badges, and found the 2009 Star Rats badge, which was a bit
of a trip, but I figured there was no way Palindrome would make a puzzle in the first round
depend on previous real-world badges. We never figured out what the years meant - after we
counted the lanyard overlaps, we were pretty sure that was correct and figured we had skipped
a step somewhere (but in reality the years were just an extra check if you ever tried sorting
the badges by alpha).

**Where the Wild Things Are** - This was the first physical puzzle, and mostly got claimed by the
Boston Hub, but the Bay Area group claimed the jigsaw puzzle, which ended up being one of the
longer ones. With no patterned edges, pairing pieces up was pretty tough. We figured out all of the
mechanics, but our data was incomplete and the meta got solved before we could patch it up.


The Ministry
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Harold and the Purple Crayon** - fun dataset, although I came in after most of the IDing was done and mostly threw around extraction ideas with other people. I don't love that you're actually supposed to throw out the ones that don't fit, but it is neat to see the final step.

**Oxford Children's Dictionary** - We pretty quickly decided that "one side will be regular definitions, and one side will be jank definitions", but it took us a long time to determine exactly what form of jank it would be. Once we got a few examples, it was pretty fun to figure out the clues, although we ended up skipping about half of the letters out of difficulty.

**The Talking Tree** - Pretty cute puzzle, and somehow these diagrams were a lot easier to fill out by intuition than the ones in the similar puzzle from Silph Puzzle Hunt. I did think it was funny that one person solving had written a phonetics puzzle in Teammate Hunt.

**Dinotopia** - I like to see puzzles as creating order out of chaos. To borrow an analogy from Alex Rubenstein's talk, it is a coincidence that the number of piano keys matches the number of constellations, but once you know this coincidence exists, you kind of have to make a puzzle that pretends this coincidence is vitally important. Sometimes you have to do a bunch of work to make the contrived coincidence work, but sometimes the pieces are already there and it feels like you're just discovering it.

In this sense, it's really cool that the writing system referenced in this puzzle is inherently ambiguous if you arrange the symbols in the right way, and that parsing out readable text is a satisfying challenge. I mostly figured out a-has of what we were supposed to do and how to extract, then got lunch while watching other people do all the work, which is really a 10/10 solve experience, would recommend.

**The Ministry** - When we unlocked The Ministry, we had 25/25 feeders thanks to backsolves. We noticed "bit = binary" right away, and I mentioned that COLORFUL HEAD could be a predicate for "starts with ROYGBIV", at which point we quickly inferred all 5 mechanics, and since this was the only puzzle we had left, I got to see the terrifying sight of Sheets locusts descend on the 5 x 25 bit matrix. I think we filled out all the bits in a minute. Very scary.

**Fruit Around** - We didn't pre-solve the "hungry caterpillar" connection before The Ministry, but we had a few minutes between solving The Ministry and doing the interaction with Palindrome, and we guessed "bookwyrm = very hungry caterpillar" in that gap, so Fruit Around was pretty straightforward for us.

In general, the construction of The Ministry is pretty impressive. I didn't even realize that the meta answers were also semantic descriptions of the bookwyrm until after we finished Hunt, but there are a lot of layers of constraints going on and it's nice how it all comes together.


Noirleans
------------------------------------------

I mostly missed this round, aside from...

**Curious and Determined** - We ended up having to backsolve this puzzle, since we didn't see the way to map letters to each clue. However, the realization that "wait it's *these* colors" was fantastic, and I thought it was funny when we said "The Shawshank Redemption isn't really any color aside from blue and orange, in the same way that every movie poster is blue and orange. I guess the main character's named Red...wait a second."


Lake Eerie
-----------------------------------------

**Large-scale Anthropomorphism** - after IDing a few of the animals, we dumped all of the animals into Google at once, and got search results for taikyoku shogi, which translates to "ultimate chess", a terrifyingly complicated game played on a 36x36 board. We IDed the appropriate adjectives, guessed the Chinese (well, Japanese) numerals were cluing rows, and figured it was a taikyoku shogi chess puzzle. That seemed like *exactly* the kind of ridiculous thing we'd need to do for a Mystery Hunt puzzle.

![Taikyoku Shogi](/public/mh-22/taikyoku.png)
{: .centered }

Now, if you solved the puzzle yourself, you might have noticed one issue - the game that's used is actually dai shogi, which is played on a 15x15 board where rows are labeled with Japanese numerals (rather than letters). Most piece movement is the same, but notably, the king in taikyoku shogi is allowed to move up to 2 spaces, which made it significantly harder to decide on the best reply. When we got the king out of checkmate, we figured we had made an error somewhere.

Interestingly, whether you interpret it as taikyoku shogi or dai shogi, you extract FIC first either way, and we said "it's probably something like FICTION or FICTIONAL or FICKLE" many times. We tried the first two, came back after someone found dai shogi, and also extracted FIC followed by weird letters as we went down a non-optimal mate. After a closer reading of the rules, we figured out the *igui* rule to take a piece without moving out of the pin,
extracting a K, and realized it was FICKLE an hour after we talked about guessing it. On one hand, we could have saved a lot of grief, but we also found the most unique part of the shogi logic, so I'm not too upset in the end.

**The Graveyard** - If I remember correctly, this was a meta that was only unlocked partway through the round. I took a look when it opened, stared a bit, tried to think of appropriately eerie connections, then said "hang on, aren't these the Pacman ghost colors?" I confirmed the year lined up, someone else found the Japanese ghost names, and then we started going on a backsolve spree. It was a little fuzzy, I believe we ended up solving from ROFA, TIONS, and a penciled in irapp on the group we had 3/4 on. (I do think it's a little odd that the Ghostbusters group was ordered by credits, when the names appear after 1/2/3/4 letters of the string.)


The Quest Coast
------------------------------------------------------

**A Number of Games** - When this unlocked, I figured I would have to work on it because I'd done a bit of combinatorial game theory before. But then it turned out teammate is just a bunch of nerds, because lots of us had done combinatorial game theor before. I drifted off of this puzzle in favor for...

**Something Command** - I'm heavily biased, but this might be my favorite puzzle from Hunt. We did the math on the Eldrazi one first, in case the indexing was based on how much over lethal you could get
After getting lethal exactly with 2 different lines (attacking with Nettle Drone or not), we believed the extraction would only be based on the missing card name, and figured out the extraction idea at 4/7.
I think the puzzle is approachable if you don't know MTG, but knowing MTG definitely made it faster, and it was cool that you could intuit your way to figuring out the missing card even if you didn't exactly work out all the math.

**Sorcery for Dummies** - Cool puzzle - I mostly came in after all the individual letters were IDed, to try to figure out paths for each monster. This ended up overlapping with technical difficulties that took down interactive puzzles though, and during the downtime I started something else. By the time we finished that, this puzzle had been completed as well.

**Once Upon a Time in the Quest** - When I went to bed around 3 AM Saturday morning, we hadn't made much progress
on this meta. I woke up at 7 AM, earlier than I planned to, seeing a message asking if anyone knew how Dinotopia work. The overnight crew had broken into the mechanic. I got on voice chat, described Dinotopia, then went back to sleep for an hour. Waking up to more forward solves in Quest, I read over the work, saw that THE DARK hadn't been
done yet, considered clue phrases that needed to start "THE DARK" instead of just "DARK", proposed "The Dark Knight", and skipped doing the work for that puzzle. That got us to 6/8 Step 3s which was enough to wheel of fortune the answer.


New You City
----------------------------------------------------------------------

**Does Any Kid Still Do This Anymore?** - I did this as my last puzzle before sleeping for Saturday, so it was mostly about grinding trigrams in a daze. I got Antioch in the first one from Nutrimatic, and decided that was fake until we did a few more examples. I remember saying, "I can confirm that kids still take the BART". That's technicaly true, but the meaning of the title became clearer after we got the main a-ha.

**Bad Beginnings** - We didn't get this until after we won Hunt, but I'm mentioning it here anyways because the dataset used is great.

**Proof by Induction** - I came in at the end, after all the ideas were figured out, to help ID some of the missing lines. I hadn't heard of this language before and it's a pretty good one.


Recipeoria
----------------------------------------------------------------------

**Sunday Dinner** - Okay, I didn't actually work on this puzzle, but I got the final answer. The call for help was "cluephrase EIGHT PAST, about NYT Sunday crossword with a food theming". I tossed some terms into Google and said ["SPAGHETTI?"](https://www.wordplays.com/crossword-solver/food-prepared-past-eight%3F)? It was right.


Heartford
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Somehow I saw nothing in this round.


Whoston
------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Rotten Little Scamps** - I pitched in a bit to some of this puzzle, which sparked an ask for "does anyone
have an Icelandic Nutrimatic", which might be the best request I heard all Hunt. We did not find an Icelandic Nutrimatic.


Reference Point
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

**You Took the Fifth** - I got tagged to work on this puzzle the moment it opened. More of a word puzzle than
an Ace Attorney puzzle, but still good, and it was cool once we figured out the reason it was presented as an
objection.lol. It did take us quite a while to decide on the right interpretation of each line, but I believe
that was part of the intended difficulty.

**On Second Thought** - Now that I think about it, I haven't seen the phonetic step in very many puzzles before, but it didn't feel too difficult when we were working on this puzzle. The puzzle is kinda ISISy, but not in a bad way.

**Diced Turkey Hash** - Something Command was my favorite puzzle of the Hunt, but Diced Turkey Hash was by far the most memorable. This was the second physical puzzle, and I do think it's a shame it unlocked so late. We figured out the binary grid pretty quickly, as well as the Mayan numerals and Tarot symbols. A bit more work got us the
Dzonghka numbers as well. From there, we figured that "face-to-face" was a clue indicating we should take a walk between adjacent faces of the d20s.
Based on the given text, we started identifying mappings between pairs of dice, noticing more relevant text every time we reread the given text.
It's impressively dense how many clues there are, especially after we figured out what "director's chair" meant.

It was definitely hard (evidently one of the least solved puzzles in Hunt),
but it was pretty satisfying to figure out the right interpretation of all the text.
We did end up running into two rabbit holes. One is that the flavor about going
on a journey really felt like we needed to trace a path along both pairs of dice,
but the final extraction only relies on the mapping between the two dice, whose
final read order doesn't depend on face topology. The specifics definitely
helped us confirm we had the right pairings and numberings, but we also managed
to argue a reasonably unique path that visited every face once. (Probably the most extreme part was when did the Tarot dice. We aimed for a path through all prime numbers
in descending order, taking the shortest path when possible. At one point, the
two primes were on completely opposite faces, but I argued that "be a walker, not a rider - but do not wait" could be interpreted as "take the shortest path that does not go through The Chariot", which actually is unique on the d20.)

The other rabbit hole is something Palindrome *definitely* did not predict. We
had rolled the dice a few times to see if they were weighted. The outputs looked
reasonable, but then we decided to try rolling them into water, since that would
magnify any weight differences. To our surprise, there **was** a consistent face
that would point up.

That led to a big debate on whether this was important puzzle content, or
whether this was a manufacturing defect. Points for puzzle content was that the
dice felt high quality and likely didn't have defects, and come on, look it keeps pointing this way up. Points
for manufacturing defect was that if the dice were weighted, it was only easily
detectable by rolling them into water, and everything else we'd discovered so
far had nothing to do with the dice's output distribution. During this debate,
one teammate drove home and back just to get a fair d20 as a control variable, and
we asked several remote teammates to roll any d20s *they* had into water to see
if they had the same phenemenon. They didn't, but the "weighting doesn't matter"
contingent wasn't convinced that meant the weighting was important. Eventually,
we decided to settle it by seeing whether the virtual version of Diced Turkey Hash
left any way for a virtual solver to learn the dice were weighted. The virtual
version wouldn't unlock for another hour, and eventually we learned that no,
the weighting didn't matter.

It wasn't real, and it wasn't intentional, but it was a very entertaining argument,
so thanks Palindrome (and thanks HRT for manufacturing slightly unfair dice).

**Reference Desk** - We random anagrammed the answer, and just could not figure out
the ordering step when trying to figure out backsolves. Without the ordering realization,
backsolving was pretty impossible, so we just left the round incomplete. We
thought we were being fairly completionist, but based on solve charts, we had
fewer solves than a lot of other teams. Our guess is that the difference comes
from solving with fewer feeders in rounds that were hard to backsolve.
