Everfree Northwest is a My Little Pony convention in the Seattle area that's been held every year for
11 years.

I'd never been to Everfree Northwest, and in fact I'd told myself I wasn't going to any more MLP
cons after BronyCon 2019. I didn't have long term friendships or connections rooted in brony fandom - what
I learned long ago is that conventions are a good way to make introductions and meet people with
common interests, but they don't handle the work of actually keeping up with people and maintaining
friendships. Unsurprisingly, this has been convered in MLP: Friendship is Magic a few times, in Amending Fences
in particular.
So, absent catching up with friends, it didn't feel like there was much cons had to offer
with the show ending.

...Except, well, online pony cons were easy to attend. BABSCon 2023 was only half an hour away, and there
was a tiny Googler brony meetup that I wanted to show up to. With the end of BronyCon, I was told that
Everfree Northwest was the largest MLP convention left. I'd never been to Everfree Northwest before,
I knew enough people in the Seattle area to turn it into a catch-up-with-friends trip, and I was just
plain curious what the state of the fandom was. So after self-declaring I was done with MLP conventions,
I booked a trip to yet another MLP convention.

My end of con reaction was basically "oh no, I had fun". Everfree Northwest was not that much better
that BABSCon - I'd say it was about 40% bigger and 30% better. But, that was enough to push it from
"I'm done" to "okay, maybe I'll come back next year". Against all odds, Everfree Northwest
is *growing*. It had 1740 attendees last year and 1800 attendees this year. Am I just,
attending pony conventions for the rest of my life? Am I one of the new age Trekkies? IS THIS MY LIFE
NOW?

"I am Cringe, but I am Free" - Socrates, probably
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The classic first sight at any MLP convention is someone in a fursuit. Every brony will tell you that
bronies are not necessarily furries, but every 2023 brony will tell you that there's a pretty strong overlap.

Still, these cons are a low judgment zone. Not zero, but low. There's definitely a vibe of "finally, I can
express myself". I don't really try to hide my brony fandom, but I don't go out of my way to express it either.
During the con, I talked to one person who felt similarly, although he said he doesn't wear pony shirts because
he lives in a red state, and would get worried about his personal safety if he was more "out" about it.

The other thing about MLP conventions is that there's a little bit of "nerd bleedover", so to speak.
One of the first panels held was basically a pure meet-and-greet "make new friends" panel, for people willing
to talk to new people but unsure how to start conversations. And well, I ended up in many more Marvel,
gaming, and comic book discussions than expected.

This year, most of the people giving autographs are from G5. A quick recap: the My Little Pony franchise
is split into different "generations", with Generation 1 starting in the 1980s. My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic
is the one that went viral, but is often shorthanded to G4, for Generation 4. G5 is the new MLP series, which...is controversial. I watched the movie, and it struck me as "just okay, has obvious flaws, but glimmers of
true quality." I don't like that it tries to share continuity with G4, it feels like it's trying to have its cake
and eat it too. Still, I know the G4 movie doesn't reflect the parts of the show that I like, so I'm trying
to reserve judgment on the cartoon proper.

Although cons and fan artists have been starting to move towards G5, the G4 mainstays still have a big chokehold.
The surprise guests this year were Nicole Oliver and Tabitha St. Germain, two of the Friendship is Magic
voice actors, and the lines for them were considerably larger than the G5 voice actor lines, or The Owl House
autograph lines. I have heard nothing but good things about The Owl House - but people aren't fans of The
Owl House in quite the same way they're fans of My Little Pony.

The next event I went to was the Pony Programming Panel. Again, there are a lot of software engineers in the fandom,
and there were three presentaitons of MLP-based programming projects. One was for [PonyGuessr](https://ponyguessr.com/),
a game about IDing an MLP episode from a single still frame. I've tried this for fun, and can manage a 50% hit rate
if I give myself infinite time. Meanwhile, I watched people at the con hit 90% accuracy within 10 seconds. Truly
terrifying.

The second was from someone trying to finetune an LLM to act as CelestAI from the Friendship is Optimal-verse.
To very briefly paraphrase the presenter, "Friendship is Optimal is a fanfiction series where a superintelligence
is put in charge of a My Little Pony MMO, and tries to maximize users through ponies. So, I decided I wanted that
in my life..." Not *quite* sure that's the right reaction. It was interesting to see that they reinvented a
synthetic data setup.

Friendship is Optimal fanfiction --> finetuned LLM --> generate FiO style dialogues --> human filtering step --> continue tuning LLM

The last was, well, I'd describe it as more of a therapy session than anything else. The presenter self-introduced
as "an Amazon engineer that works on things that don't matter", then went on a rant about 8 years of tech debt in
the pony-themed Discord bot they wrote. I learned nothing.


Twilight's Book Nook
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The MLP fandom has produced a lot of fanfiction. There are at least 3 different fan projects based on publishing
fanfiction at-cost. I'd say the big one I was following was Ministry of Image (named after an org in kkat's Fallout Equestria).
I've had my eye on their books for
a while - the main issue is that they ship out of Russia, which meant a large shipping cost pre-Ukraine and
a vague "uhhhhh" post-Ukraine.

[Twilight's Book Nook](https://twilightsbooknook.com/) is, roughly, an aggregator that gets books from the different
publishing projects, and then goes to conventions to advertise and sell them. I went back and forth on buying them,
they're not actually cheaper because they pass on the Russian shipping cost. But eventually the vibe of "spend your
money" won me over and I bought two.

I have read Eakin's Time Loop Trilogy before, but haven't read Prey and got it almost exclusively off the back of
kkat's name. Hopefully it's good. One thing I appreciate about both Eakin and kkat is that they keep things short. Their
stories are concise in their word choice, in a way that lots of serial fanfiction is not.


"How Long Are You Out Again?"
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All the pony conventions I've been to have had raves in the evening, always with a horse pun. Everfree Northwest's
is called Ponystock.

Are these raves good? Ehhhhhhh. If you want drugs, there's fewer drugs (being held in a hotel means the rules are
much stricter than an open air music festival).
