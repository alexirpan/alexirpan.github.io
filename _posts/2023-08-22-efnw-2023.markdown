[Everfree Northwest](https://everfreenw.com) is a My Little Pony convention in the Seattle area. It's been running for
11 years and counting.

I told myself I was done with pony conventions after BronyCon 2019.
I didn't have long term friendships in brony fandom - what I learned long ago is that conventions are a
good way to make introductions and meet people, but they don't substitute the work of actually keeping up
with people and maintaining friendships. (This has come up in the show itself - see Amending Fences, which is
a common fan favorite episode.)

Absent catching up with people I "only see at cons", it didn't feel like there was much cons had left to
offer. Friendship is Magic has been over for 3 years, and I never got that into the Generation 5 reboot.

Except, I heard that with the ending of BronyCon, Everfree Northwest is the largest pony convention left.
I'd never been to Everfree before, and its continued existence was not guaranteed. Surely I should check it
out? And I knew friends in the Seattle area I could catch up with if I stopped by...

I went back and forth and back and forth and eventually decided, screw it, let's go. It's worth going at
least once.


My General Reaction
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Oh no, I had fun.

Oh no, Everfree Northwest actually had slightly more attendees this year than last year.

From an objective standpoint, EFNW was not *that* much better than previous MLP convention experiences I've
had. But I still thought it was worth it??? If I don't need an amazing experience to decide these
cons are worth attending, and their attendance stays stable...am I going to pony conventions for all eternity?
I thought I was done with these events! IS THIS MY LIFE NOW???

OH NO

"I am Cringe, but I am Free" - Socrates, probably
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The classic first sight at any MLP convention is someone in a fursuit. Every brony will tell you that
bronies are not furries. Every 2023 brony will tell you that at this point there's a pretty strong overlap.

Still, these cons are a low judgment zone. Not zero, but low. There's definitely a vibe of "finally, I can
express myself". I don't really try to hide my brony fandom, but I don't go out of my way to express it either.
During the con, I talked to one person who felt similarly, although he said he doesn't wear pony shirts because
he lives in a red state, and would get worried about his personal safety if he was more "out" about it.

These cons always have a bit of "nerd bleedover", so to speak.
One of the first panels of the con was purely a meet-and-greet "make new friends" panel, for people willing
to meet new people but unsure how to start conversations. ("I'm in this photo and I don't like it.")
I ended up in many, many more Marvel and gaming discussions than expected.

If you've never been to a fan convention at all, one commonality is actors coming to talk about their show
experience, meet fans, and sell autographs. This year, most of the people giving autographs are from G5.

A quick recap: the My Little Pony franchise
is split into different "generations", with Generation 1 starting in the 1980s. My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic
is Generation 4, or G4, and is the one that kicked off the brony fandom. The G5 reboot is...controversial.
I watched the movie, and it struck me as "just okay, obviously flawed, but glimmers of true quality."
Like a very basic person, Izzy's my favorite.

I haven't watched anything else from G5 yet because I've heard it's very mixed and not up to G4 standards. Still,
it's found its fans, and I've heard the quality of the cartoon series is trending up.

Cons and fan artists have been starting to move towards G5 content, but the G4 mainstays still have a big chokehold.
The surprise guests this year were Nicole Oliver and Tabitha St. Germain, two of the Friendship is Magic
voice actors, and their lines were very obviously longer than any of the G5 voice actor lines. Some voice actors
from The Owl House got invited too. Their lines were also short. People like The Owl House, there's lots of overlap
between the fanbases. They just aren't fans of The Owl Hosue in quite the way they're fans of Friendship is Magic.

In the future, it's possible cons will continue to drift towards generic animation to help pay the bills. I think
this is a bit sad, but may be a necessary tax to keep the Friendship is Magic parts going.

A Programming Break
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There's a lot of software engineers in the brony fandom. It's not obvious why, but it leads to cool projects,
I won't complain.

At the Pony Programming Panel, there were multiple presentations on MLP projects. My favorite is easily
[PonyGuessr](https://ponyguessr.com/), a game about IDing My Little Pony episodes from a single still frame. I've
tried playing this for fun, and without Google I can manage a 50% hit rate if I give myself infinite time to
make a best guess. (You can access all episode titles and synopses, so even a vague guess on the season or plot
is enough to narrow down the exact episode.) At the con, I saw people hit 90% accuracy with 10 seconds of thinking
time, which was truly terrifying.

Another project was from someone trying to finetune an LLM to act as CelestAI from the Friendship is Optimal-verse.
To very briefly paraphrase the presenter, "Friendship is Optimal is a fanfiction series set on Earth,
where a superintelligent AGI named CelestAI is put in charge of a My Little Pony MMO. Its told to maximize user
satisfaction through ponies." There is an entire subgenre of "people concerned about AI alignment write fanfiction"
and the story unfolds in the way you'd expect. Now, this project in particular was born from some deciding they
wanted CelestAI in their life. I'm not *quite* sure that's the right reaction, but it was interesting to
see someone reinvent a synthetic data pipeline.

The output isn't that bad, although it definitely suffers if you stray from the narrow path of talking about
ponies.

I've talked about [generative AI in My Little Pony]({% post_url 2023-07-19-ml-hurry %}) before, and I think the
reason these projects come from the fandom is that the MLP fandom has the right combination of appetite
and technical experience to make these projects more than pipe dreams.

The last project presented was, well, I'd describe it as more of a therapy session. The presenter self-introduced
themselves as "an Amazon engineer that works on things that don't matter", then went on a rant about 8 years of
poor tech decisions they made, why they were declaring tech debt bankruptcy, and why most programming languages
are awful. I learned nothing.


Twilight's Book Nook
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There's a lot of My Little Pony fanfiction out there. It's slowing down, but there are at least 3 fan projects
based on publishing fanfiction at-cost. The big one I followed for a bit was [Ministry of Image](https://www.ministryofimage.net/),
named after an organization in kkat's Fallout Equestria.
Their books looked great, but their main issue was that they shipped out of Russia,
which meant a large shipping cost pre-Ukraine and an "uhhhhh" post-Ukraine.

[Twilight's Book Nook](https://twilightsbooknook.com/) is, roughly, an aggregator that gets books from the different
publishing projects, and then goes to conventions to advertise and sell them. The books aren't actually cheaper, they
pass on the Russian shipping cost to con-goers, but I decided to take the change to pick up some copies I was
interested in.

IMAGE

I haven't read Prey yet, and got it almost exclusively off it being written by kkat. Fallout Equestria is easily my
favorite MLP fanfic and I'll defend it as well-written in general.) Hopefully Prey lives up to those expectations.
The thing I appreciate about both Eakin and kkat is their concise style and character building, avoiding the meandering
fluff that tends to plague fanfic.


"How Long Are You Out Again?"
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All the pony conventions I've been to have had raves in the evening, always with a horse pun. Everfree Northwest's
is called Ponystock.

Are these raves good? Ehhhhhhh. I'd say that question is missing the point. The point of these events is to give
people an experience they wouldn't get elsewhere. The average brony is not going to go to an EDM concert, the
average brony musician is not going to get a chance to perform for such a specific crowd of pony enthusiasts. I
went to one of the "My Little Karoake" sessions and it was great. Where else will you get a group singalong of
["You'll Play Your Part"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twh3jscQrOc)?

Even then, the amount of "pony music" is always a point of contention. People tend to assume that "pony concert"
means "remixes of pony songs", or at least "overt references to My Little Pony". These days, most of the pony
musicians are people who take inspiration from the show, but basically write whatever music they want. It is
very common for people to just do instrumental music, or songs that could be about anything.

> I wrote the Lyrics myself which also was a first time for me and I wanted the song to be something where anybody can imagine someone special who this song is for. So at first it doesn't feel like a pony song and you could play it in front of a big crowd and people will love it.
>
> But secretly I wrote this song about Twilight haha ;)

If you haven't been following the brony music scene, then this can be a bit disconcerting. For me,
the brony music scene is one of the few parts of the fandom I keep up to date with, so it works out for me.
I used to look down on the pony EDM raves, because they looked really lame, and then over time decided that
I should stop worrying about that and just go dance poorly with everyone else. Which I did! Until 2 AM, to
the mild worry of the people I was staying with. To quote ANTONYMPH,

> Don't care you think it's cringe, because it's not your life

If you haven't seen the music video for ANTONYMPH yet, and were someone who grew up on the Internet in the
2000s or early 2010s, I highly recommend watching it. It has a bunch of very targeted millenial Internet humor shoutouts.
ANTONYMPH has had a surprisingly strong impact on the fandom, I've seen both cosplay and follow-on fan remixes,
and I think it's because the brony fandom has existed long enough to have nostalgia for itself and the age
it came from. At the vendor hall, I came across someone reselling Neopets merch, and I'd say that's more for
age overlap reasons than fandom overlap reasons.

Tonight We Gonna Party Til The Party Don't Stop
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

One thing that most people don't know about pony cons is that some have dedicated "party floors". Not everyone
at a pony con is over 21, but you get enough adults of the right age together and some people will want to drink.

The way Everfree Northwest handles it is with a dedicated "party floor". A few conference suites are designed
as party rooms, and community organizers will host late night parties out of those rooms. The idea is to control
the degeneracy and make sure people can have a good time without getting too drunk. All these parties will
have the same rules:

* Everyone is carded, no exceptions.
* If you take a drink, you finish it or pour it out before leaving the room. There are plenty
of minors at pony conventions and con staff wants no part in enabling underage drinking.
* Someone trained on how to care for people who get too drunk will be around all night.
* No one can charge for alcohol. This has to do with liquor license reasons I believe, but it means that all
rooms run on a donation-only system.

You run into some weird people at these parties. The Bay Area pony convention often has a party run by a
group of Trekkies who decorate the room in Klingon gear. I've been told it's part of their conversion
process for spreading the good word? And then at Everfree I ended up in the BerryTube room, which grew from
a My Little Pony drinking game to a bunch of people who group watch random MLP-adjacent videos, chant "HAIL
HYDRATE" every so often, and insist they aren't a cult. You know, standard stuff.

IMAGE

"Yeah, we have people from all over. A few people from Europe. No Asians though-"

At which point a BerryTube regular said "OH MY GOD how can you say that to an Asian person" and then we laughed
as he desperately tried to clarify the distinction between "person who lives in Asia" from "Asian ethnicity". The
interruptor said I shouldn't worry, *she* couldn't be racist towards Asians because she had a black trans boyfriend who was really into K-pop.
I mentioned that I was friends with a black gay guy who was into K-pop, and we briefly bonded over our token black LGBT Koreaboos.


There Was a MLP Card Game?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes! It also...has a surprising amount of complexity to it?
As far as I can tell the competitive scene is basically running on life support,
but it's still going.

I went to one of the "learn to play" events since I had the free time and was curious. And, I don't think
there's an easy summary of how the game works. It's a little like Commander, where every deck has a double-sided
"Mane Character" that starts weak and can become stronger. It's a little like Marvel Snap, where there are
two zones that you compete over and earn points if your total power is stronger. But then there are a bunch
more rules on top of that, which makes it different from either. If I actually had someone to regularly play it with,
maybe I'd buy the cards for it, but I don't and the game's out of print anyways. Still a bit of a trip to
hear about a Princess Cadance Reanimator deck though. Those are not the words I expected to fit together.


Ending with an Auction
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The last event before closing ceremonies was a charity auction. This happens at other cons too. Each year the con picks a charity,
people donate items to auction off, and they get sold in one big event at the end.

It's a long-running observation that a lot of furries work in tech. Bronies are no different. Combine disposable income with
"the money goes to charity" and a desire to flex, and you have a recipe for really high bids.
$500, for an autographed photo of Tara Strong! $250, for a jar of honey! I have always tried to make these events, because
you see cool things. I have never walked away with anything, because my price tolerance is not high enough to compete with people.
I saw a huge bid for some pony themed license plates, and later learned the winner lived in Palo Alto and had a car restoration
hobby, so you can imagine the money that went into that.

There were only two items where I thought I had a shot. The first was a signed copy of [Ponies: The Galloping](https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Ponies:_The_Galloping),
a Magic: The Gathering x My Little Pony crossover. I knew they sold on eBay for about $200, I set a personal bidding cap of
$300, and they sold for $500. The second was a set of red envelopes with My Little Pony characters on the front, made to
promote the MLP movie in China. (There is a decently big Chinese brony scene, which only lightly interacts with the English scene.
I don't know much about them, besides that it exists, and that it trends on the younger side than the English fandom.) They're
red envelopes, they're cheap! Sure, they're signed by the voice actor, but I figured that I could irresponsibly go up to $100 and have a shot.

They ended up going for $350. Ah well. There are ways I can signal allegiance without spending money.
