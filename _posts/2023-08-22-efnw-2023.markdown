Everfree Northwest is a My Little Pony convention in the Seattle area that's been held every year for
11 years.

I'd never been to Everfree Northwest, and in fact I'd told myself I wasn't going to any more MLP
cons after BronyCon 2019. I didn't have long term friendships or connections rooted in brony fandom - what
I learned long ago is that conventions are a good way to make introductions and meet people with
common interests, but they don't handle the work of actually keeping up with people and maintaining
friendships. Unsurprisingly, this has been convered in MLP: Friendship is Magic a few times, in Amending Fences
in particular.
So, absent catching up with friends, it didn't feel like there was much cons had to offer
with the show ending.

...Except, well, online pony cons were easy to attend. BABSCon 2023 was only half an hour away, and there
was a tiny Googler brony meetup that I wanted to show up to. With the end of BronyCon, I was told that
Everfree Northwest was the largest MLP convention left. I'd never been to Everfree Northwest before,
I knew enough people in the Seattle area to turn it into a catch-up-with-friends trip, and I was just
plain curious what the state of the fandom was. So after self-declaring I was done with MLP conventions,
I booked a trip to yet another MLP convention.

My end of con reaction was basically "oh no, I had fun". Everfree Northwest was not that much better
that BABSCon - I'd say it was about 40% bigger and 30% better. But, that was enough to push it from
"I'm done" to "okay, maybe I'll come back next year". Against all odds, Everfree Northwest
is *growing*. It had 1740 attendees last year and 1800 attendees this year. Am I just,
attending pony conventions for the rest of my life? Am I one of the new age Trekkies? IS THIS MY LIFE
NOW?

"I am Cringe, but I am Free" - Socrates, probably
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The classic first sight at any MLP convention is someone in a fursuit. Every brony will tell you that
bronies are not necessarily furries, but every 2023 brony will tell you that there's a pretty strong overlap.

Still, these cons are a low judgment zone. Not zero, but low. There's definitely a vibe of "finally, I can
express myself". I don't really try to hide my brony fandom, but I don't go out of my way to express it either.
During the con, I talked to one person who felt similarly, although he said he doesn't wear pony shirts because
he lives in a red state, and would get worried about his personal safety if he was more "out" about it.

The other thing about MLP conventions is that there's a little bit of "nerd bleedover", so to speak.
One of the first panels held was basically a pure meet-and-greet "make new friends" panel, for people willing
to talk to new people but unsure how to start conversations. And well, I ended up in many more Marvel,
gaming, and comic book discussions than expected.

This year, most of the people giving autographs are from G5. A quick recap: the My Little Pony franchise
is split into different "generations", with Generation 1 starting in the 1980s. My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic
is the one that went viral, but is often shorthanded to G4, for Generation 4. G5 is the new MLP series, which...is controversial. I watched the movie, and it struck me as "just okay, has obvious flaws, but glimmers of
true quality." I don't like that it tries to share continuity with G4, it feels like it's trying to have its cake
and eat it too. Still, I know the G4 movie doesn't reflect the parts of the show that I like, so I'm trying
to reserve judgment on the cartoon proper.

Although cons and fan artists have been starting to move towards G5, the G4 mainstays still have a big chokehold.
The surprise guests this year were Nicole Oliver and Tabitha St. Germain, two of the Friendship is Magic
voice actors, and the lines for them were considerably larger than the G5 voice actor lines, or The Owl House
autograph lines. I have heard nothing but good things about The Owl House - but people aren't fans of The
Owl House in quite the same way they're fans of My Little Pony. It creates a lot of uncertainty in the fandom.
Some people like that pony conventions are very MLP-centered, but branching out helps pay the bills. To me,
I see it as the tax needed to keep the G4 parts going.

The next event I went to was the Pony Programming Panel. Again, there are a lot of software engineers in the fandom,
and there were three presentaitons of MLP-based programming projects. One was for [PonyGuessr](https://ponyguessr.com/),
a game about IDing an MLP episode from a single still frame. I've tried this for fun, and can manage a 50% hit rate
if I give myself infinite time. Meanwhile, I watched people at the con hit 90% accuracy within 10 seconds. Truly
terrifying.

The second was from someone trying to finetune an LLM to act as CelestAI from the Friendship is Optimal-verse.
To very briefly paraphrase the presenter, "Friendship is Optimal is a fanfiction series where a superintelligence
is put in charge of a My Little Pony MMO, and tries to maximize users through ponies. So, I decided I wanted that
in my life..." Not *quite* sure that's the right reaction. It was interesting to see that they reinvented a
synthetic data setup.

Friendship is Optimal fanfiction --> finetuned LLM --> generate FiO style dialogues --> human filtering step --> continue tuning LLM

The last was, well, I'd describe it as more of a therapy session than anything else. The presenter self-introduced
as "an Amazon engineer that works on things that don't matter", then went on a rant about 8 years of tech debt in
the pony-themed Discord bot they wrote. I learned nothing.


Twilight's Book Nook
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The MLP fandom has produced a lot of fanfiction. There are at least 3 different fan projects based on publishing
fanfiction at-cost. I'd say the big one I was following was Ministry of Image (named after an org in kkat's Fallout Equestria).
I've had my eye on their books for
a while - the main issue is that they ship out of Russia, which meant a large shipping cost pre-Ukraine and
a vague "uhhhhh" post-Ukraine.

[Twilight's Book Nook](https://twilightsbooknook.com/) is, roughly, an aggregator that gets books from the different
publishing projects, and then goes to conventions to advertise and sell them. I went back and forth on buying them,
they're not actually cheaper because they pass on the Russian shipping cost. But eventually the vibe of "spend your
money" won me over and I bought two.

I have read Eakin's Time Loop Trilogy before, but haven't read Prey and got it almost exclusively off the back of
kkat's name. Hopefully it's good. One thing I appreciate about both Eakin and kkat is that they keep things short. Their
stories are concise in their word choice, in a way that lots of serial fanfiction is not.


"How Long Are You Out Again?"
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All the pony conventions I've been to have had raves in the evening, always with a horse pun. Everfree Northwest's
is called Ponystock.

Are these raves good? Ehhhhhhh. I'd say that question is missing the point. The point of these events is to give
people an experience they wouldn't get elsewhere. The average brony is not going to go to an EDM concert, the
average brony musician is not going to get a chance to perform for such a specific crowd of pony enthusiasts. I
went to one of the "My Little Karoake" sessions and it was great. Where else will you get a group singalong of
["You'll Play Your Part"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twh3jscQrOc)?

Even then, the amount of "pony music" is always a point of contention. People tend to assume that "pony concert"
means "remixes of pony songs", or at least "overt references to My Little Pony". These days, most of the pony
musicians are people who take inspiration from the show, but basically write whatever music they want. It is
very common for people to just do instrumental music, or songs that could be about anything.

> I wrote the Lyrics myself which also was a first time for me and I wanted the song to be something where anybody can imagine someone special who this song is for. So at first it doesn't feel like a pony song and you could play it in front of a big crowd and people will love it.
>
> But secretly I wrote this song about Twilight haha ;)

If you haven't been following the brony music scene, then this can be a bit disconcerting. For me,
the brony music scene is one of the few parts of the fandom I keep up to date with, so it works out for me.
I used to look down on the pony EDM raves, because they looked really lame, and then over time decided that
I should stop worrying about that and just go dance poorly with everyone else. Which I did! Until 2 AM, to
the mild worry of the people I was staying with. To quote ANTONYMPH,

> Don't care you think it's cringe, because it's not your life

If you haven't seen the music video for ANTONYMPH yet, and were someone who grew up on the Internet in the
2000s or early 2010s, I highly recommend watching it. It has a bunch of very targeted millenial Internet humor shoutouts.
ANTONYMPH has had a surprisingly strong impact on the fandom, I've seen both cosplay and follow-on fan remixes,
and I think it's because the brony fandom has existed long enough to have nostalgia for itself and the age
it came from. At the vendor hall, I came across someone reselling Neopets merch, and I'd say that's more for
age overlap reasons than fandom overlap reasons.

Tonight We Gonna Party Til The Party Don't Stop
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

One thing that most people don't know about pony cons is that some have dedicated "party floors". Not everyone
at a pony con is over 21, but you get enough adults of the right age together and some people will want to drink.

The way Everfree Northwest handles it is with a dedicated "party floor". A few conference suites are designed
as party rooms, and community organizers will host late night parties out of those rooms. The idea is to control
the degeneracy and make sure people can have a good time without getting too drunk. All these parties will
have the same rules:

* Everyone is carded, no exceptions.
* If you take a drink, you finish it or pour it out before leaving the room. There are plenty
of minors at pony conventions and con staff wants no part in enabling underage drinking.
* Someone trained on how to care for people who get too drunk will be around all night.
* No one can charge for alcohol. This has to do with liquor license reasons I believe, but it means that all
rooms run on a donation-only system.

You run into some weird people at these parties. The Bay Area pony convention often has a party run by a
group of Trekkies who decorate the room in Klingon gear. I've been told it's part of their conversion
process for spreading the good word? And then at Everfree I ended up in the BerryTube room, which grew from
a My Little Pony drinking game to a bunch of people who group watch random MLP-adjacent videos, chant "HAIL
HYDRATE" every so often, and insist they aren't a cult. You know, standard stuff.

IMAGE

"Yeah, we have people from all over. A few people from Europe. No Asians though-"

At which point a BerryTube regular said "OH MY GOD how can you say that to an Asian person" and then we laughed
as he desperately tried to clarify the distinction between "person who lives in Asia" from "Asian ethnicity". The
interruptor said I shouldn't worry, *she* couldn't be racist towards Asians because she had a black trans boyfriend who was really into K-pop.
I mentioned that I was friends with a black gay guy who was into K-pop, and we briefly bonded over our token black LGBT Koreaboos.


There Was a MLP Card Game?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes! It also...has a surprising amount of complexity to it?
As far as I can tell the competitive scene is basically running on life support,
but it's still going.

I went to one of the "learn to play" events since I had the free time and was curious. And, I don't think
there's an easy summary of how the game works. It's a little like Commander, where every deck has a double-sided
"Mane Character" that starts weak and can become stronger. It's a little like Marvel Snap, where there are
two zones that you compete over and earn points if your total power is stronger. But then there are a bunch
more rules on top of that, which makes it different from either. If I actually had someone to regularly play it with,
maybe I'd buy the cards for it, but I don't and the game's out of print anyways. Still a bit of a trip to
hear about a Princess Cadance Reanimator deck though. Those are not the words I expected to fit together.


Ending with an Auction
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The last event before closing ceremonies was a charity auction. This happens at other cons too. Each year the con picks a charity,
people donate items to auction off, and they get sold in one big event at the end.

It's a long-running observation that a lot of furries work in tech. Bronies are no different. Combine disposable income with
"the money goes to charity" and a desire to flex, and you have a recipe for really high bids.
$500, for an autographed photo of Tara Strong! $250, for a jar of honey! I have always tried to make these events, because
you see cool things. I have never walked away with anything, because my price tolerance is not high enough to compete with people.
I saw a huge bid for some pony themed license plates, and later learned the winner lived in Palo Alto and had a car restoration
hobby, so you can imagine the money that went into that.

There were only two items where I thought I had a shot. The first was a signed copy of [Ponies: The Galloping](https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Ponies:_The_Galloping),
a Magic: The Gathering x My Little Pony crossover. I knew they sold on eBay for about $200, I set a personal bidding cap of
$300, and they sold for $500. The second was a set of red envelopes with My Little Pony characters on the front, made to
promote the MLP movie in China. (There is a decently big Chinese brony scene, which only lightly interacts with the English scene.
I don't know much about them, besides that it exists, and that it trends on the younger side than the English fandom.) They're
red envelopes, they're cheap! Sure, they're signed by the voice actor, but I figured that I could irresponsibly go up to $100 and have a shot.

They ended up going for $350. Ah well. There are ways I can signal allegiance without spending money.
