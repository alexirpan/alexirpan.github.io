title:  "My AI Timelines Have Sped Up (Again)"
date:   2023-12-29 15:08:00 -0700
---

In August 2020, I wrote a post about [my AI timelines]({% post_url 2020-08-18-ai-timelines %}).
Using the following definition of AGI:

> An AI system that matches or exceeds humans at almost all (95%+)
> economically valuable work.

My forecast at the time was:

* 10% chance by 2035
* 50% chance by 2045
* 90% chance by 2070

Now I would say it's more like:

* 10% chance by 2028 (5ish years)
* 25% chance by 2035 (10ish years)
* 50% chance by 2045
* 90% chance by 2070

To explain why, I think it would be most instructive to directly compare my 2020 post to my current
one.


The Role of Compute
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

When I thought about AGI before, I saw two broad theories about the world.

**Hypothesis 1:** Scaling is enough for AGI. Many problems we consider challenging will disappear
at scale. Making models bigger won't be easy, but the challenges behind scaling up models will be tackled and solved sooner rather than later, and the rest will follow.

**Hypothesis 2:** Scaling current methods is not the right paradigm. It is undeniably important,
but we will reach the limits
of what scale can do, find we are not at AGI, and need new clever ideas to even find the correct next hill to climb. Doing so will take a while.

Quoting myself from 2020,

Most of the reason I started believing in faster timelines in 2020 was because I thought
hypothesis 1 (the scaling hypothesis) had proved it had real weight behind it. Not enough to
declare it had won, but enough that it deserved attention.

Now that it's 2024, do I get to say I called it? The view of "things emerge
at scale" is significantly more mainstream these days. I totally called it. This is the main
reason that I feel compelled to keep my 50% / 90% numbers the same but stretch my 10% number
forward. If scaling stops then it'll take a while, and if it keeps going I don't think
it'll take that long. The evidence so far suggests that the scaling hypothesis is more likely to be true.

If there is something I did not call, it would be the flexibility of next token prediction.

It turned out that next token prediction was enough to *pretend* to follow intent,
if you finetuned on enough "instruction: example" data, and pretending to follow intent is
close enough to actually following intent.
Supervised finetuning with the same loss was good enough and it was not much more difficult than that.
The finding that [instruction fine-tuning let
a 1.5B model outperform an untuned 175B model](https://openai.com/research/instruction-following)
was basically what made ChatGPT possible at current compute.

I was correct in claiming
that something very important was happening at scale. I was wrong in how many
ideas would be needed to exploit it.

(Move this to later.)

This is not to say that it's just "numbers go up, use more hardware, hurr durr new state-of-the-art".
A friend reminded me that for every LLaMa, there's a [Meta OPT](https://ai.meta.com/blog/democratizing-access-to-large-scale-language-models-with-opt-175b/) that doesn't live up to expectations.
If you're bored one day, the team behind OPT released a [very detailed logbook](https://github.com/facebookresearch/metaseq/tree/main/projects/OPT/chronicles) of the issues
they ran into. Gradient overflows during Thanksgiving, mysterious activation norm spikes that
traced to an accidental library upgrade, and more. There are problems to solve there.


Every day it gets harder to argue it's impossible to brute force the step-functions
between toy and product with just scale and the right dataset.
I've been converted to the compute hype-train and think the fraction is like 80% compute
20% better ideas. Ideas are still important - things like chain-of-thought have been
especially influential, and in that respect, leveraging LLMs better is still an ideas game.
At least for now - [see experiments](https://openreview.net/forum?id=92gvk82DE-) on [LLM-driven prompt optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03409). Honestly
it wouldn't shock me if a lot of automatic prompt generation happens right now and just
doesn't get published, based on [what people have figured out about DALL-E 3](https://simonwillison.net/2023/Oct/26/add-a-walrus/).


Unsupervised Learning

Ah, transfer learning. I remember the good old days, where people got excited about
a paper that did like, 5 tasks, and showed you could speed up learning at a 6th task. Now it is
all about large internet-scale models that have gone through enough rounds of next token
prediction to zero-shot a wide class of tasks. Or to quote work from my colleagues,
"[large language models are general pattern machines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04721)".
As far as I know, the dedicated transfer learning techniques like [PCGrad](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.06782) are not
only unused, they don't get much further research either.

Suffice it to say that unsupervised and self-supervised methods have continued to shine as
the dark matter powering every large language and multimodal model. They still appear to
be the best methods for vaccuuming up compute and data. Throw everything in the hole
and the hole will provide.

There is still a role for supervised learning and reinforcement learning, but they certainly
have less hype behind them. I remember when deep reinforcement learning was at peak
hype, people accused it of being horribly inefficient. Which it was! The reply I'd always give
was that deep RL from scratch was insane, but it was a useful way to benchmark RL methods.
The long run would eventually look like doing RL on top of a model trained via
other means.

Fast forward to now, and I got my wish, except I'm not happy about it. RLHF people tell me that they think pretty
much any RL algorithm will give okay results as long as you have good preference data, and
the most important questions are the ones surrounding the RL algorithm.

![Yann LeCun cake slide](/public/ai-timelines-2023/yanncake.webp)
{: .centered }

Calling back to the famous cake slide from [Yann LeCun's NeurIPS 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ount2Y4qxQo) talk on predictive learning, people respect the cherry but it's natural
for people to care more about the cake. The slide is "slightly offensive" but I'd say it
came slightly true.

I still think
better generic RL algorithms are out there, and they would make RLHF better, but it's harder to justify searching for them when you
could spend the marginal compute on extra pretraining or supervised fine-tuning instead. Robot
learning in particular has drifted towards imitation learning because it's easier to work with
and uses compute more effectively.
At least
in my research bubble, the field is drifting from generic RL methods to ones that exploit
the structure of preference data, like [DPO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18290) and its siblings.
Still, I feel obligated to plug [Q-Transformer](https://qtransformer.github.io/), a generic RL + Transformers paper I worked on this year.


Better Tooling

Nothing in the tooling department has really *surprised* me. However, as
more people have moved to Transformers-by-default, the tools have become more specialized
and concentrated. Stuff like [FlashAttention](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention)
wouldn't be as much of a thing if it weren't relevant to like, literally every modern
ML project.

If I had to pick something I missed,
it would be the rise of "research via API calls". API owners have a wider audience of
hobbyists, developers, and researchers, which justifies focusing more on user experience.
I also liked [Pete Warden's](https://petewarden.com/2023/10/15/the-unstoppable-rise-of-disposable-ml-frameworks/)
take, that people are increasingly interested in "the codebase that's already integrated
LLaMa or Whisper", since they don't need everything a generic ML framework provides.

Overall I'd say tools are progressing as expected and don't impact my timeline opinions.
I may have been surprised at *when* LLM assistants appeared, but I always expected something
like them to arrive.


Scaling Laws
-----------------------------------------------------

At the time I wrote the original post, the accepted scaling laws were from [Kaplan et al, 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08361), and still had
room for a few orders of magnitude.

Two years after that post, [Hoffman et al, 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15556) announced Chinchilla scaling laws showing that models could be much smaller given a fixed FLOPs budget, as long as you had a larger dataset.
An important detail is that Chincilla scaling laws were estimated assuming that you train a model, then run inference once on your benchmark. However, in a world where most large models are run for inference many times (as part of products or APIs), it's more compute optimal to train for longer than Chinchilla recommends, once you account for inference cost. Further [analysis from Thaddée Yann TYL's blog](https://espadrine.github.io/blog/posts/chinchilla-s-death.html) suggests model sizes could potentially be even lower than previously assumed.

Despite the dramatic reductions in model size, I don't think the adjustments to scaling laws are that important to
model capabilities. I'm guessing the Pareto frontier has bent slightly, but not in a dramatic way. Maybe I am wrong, I have not seen the hard numbers because it seems like literally every
lab with the resources has decided that scaling laws are now need-to-know trade secrets. But for now, I am assuming that FLOPs and data are the bottleneck,
and if you control for both we are only slightly more efficient and new scaling laws haven't
affected timelines too much.

I'd say the most important consequence is that *inference times are much smaller than previously projected*.
In combination with smaller model sizes, there's been a lot of progress in quantization
to make those models even smaller in scenarios where you're time or memory limited.
That's made products faster than they otherwise would be pre-Chinchilla.
In the early 2010s, Google did a lot
of research into how much delays impact search engine usage, and the conclusion was ["it matters a ton"](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/future-of-marketing/digital-transformation/the-google-gospel-of-speed-urs-hoelzle/). When search engines are slow, people use them less, even if the
quality is worth waiting for. ML products are no different.

Speaking of...


Rise of the Product Cycle
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As part of the 2020 post, I did an exercise I called "trying hard to say no". I decided to start from
the base assumption that short-term AGI was possible, put forward my best guess as to
how we'd end up in that world, then see how plausible I found that story to be.
The reason to do this is because if you want to be correct that AGI is far away,
you have to refute the strongest argument in favor of short-term AGI - so you should at least be able to refute the strongest argument you come up with yourself.

At the time, I described a hypothetical future where not many ideas would be needed,
aside from scale. I assumed someone developed an AI-powered app that's useful enough for
the average person.

> Perhaps someone develops an app or tool, using a model of GPT-3's size or
> larger, that's a huge productivity multiplier. Imagine the first computers,
> Lotus Notes, or Microsoft Excel taking over the business world.

This hypothetical app would bring enough revenue to fund its own improvement.

Since this idea would be based on scale, it would imply the concentration of research into a narrower set of ideas.

I thought this was a helpful exercise, and concluded by saying
"the number of things that have to go right makes me think
it's unlikely this will occur, but it's worth considering".

And then everything I thought was unlikely came true.

We have a ChatGPT app, which went viral
and inspired a large cast of competitors. It is not a huge productivity booster, but
it's enough of one that people are willing to pay for it.
Supposedly [Microsoft loses $20/user on
Copilot](https://aibusiness.com/nlp/github-copilot-loses-20-a-month-per-user), but
[David Holz's has claimed Midjourney is already profitable](https://www.theregister.com/2022/08/01/david_holz_midjourney/).
I'd split the difference and say most AI services could be profitable, but run at a loss in the name
of growth.

This has driven tech giants and VCs to throw billions at hardware and ML talent hiring.
Deep learning is old news - now everyone says "LLM" or "generative AI" or "prompt engineering". [Masked Autoencoders](https://openreview.net/forum?id=MAMOi89bOL) are handling audio,
multimodal Gemini and GPT-4V handle vision, and a few [video generation](https://makepixelsdance.github.io/) models are uncanny
but making good progress.

To me it now seems completely obvious that transformers will be pushed much, much further
than any other model architecture in the history of machine learning. There is too much
hype, the scaling is inevitable, and even if the doomers' point of view becomes more popular,
there are enough optimists that I expect *somebody* will push forward,
safety and alignment and fairness concerns be damned.
To borrow a point from [Gwern's essay on timing](https://gwern.net/timing),
speculative technology is created by the experts with the
most faith that it will succeed. It will always seem insane
that those experts could be correct, and in fact those experts will usually be too early,
but when they are right they will succeed before the world catches up to their ideas.
And experts with the most faith tend to *understand*
the possible negative externalities, but assume they'll be fine. For better or for worse.


Trying to Say No, Again
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's run this exercise of "let's assume near-term AGI is possible, how do we get there" again,
to see what's changed.

Once again, we'd assume progress comes primarily from larger compute budgets and scale.
Maybe it's not transformers, maybe one of the
"transformer replacements" that claims to be more efficient will finally win. (I know some people are excited about [Mamba and other state-space models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00752).)
Increasing parameter count is very easy if you
have the compute and data to exploit it, so let's assume the bottlenecks are on compute
and data. We can take "ML powers products powers funding powers ML" as a given. That's just
what's happening. The question is whether something will make scaling fail.

I don't really know enough about hardware to discuss it in any detail, so let's just assume
it'll continue to grow. Chips have gotten more expensive, given that everyone is keeping their eyes on it,
including nation states. Still, computers are useful, ML models are useful, and even if
models fail to scale, people will want to fit GPT-4 sized models on their phone.
It seems reasonable to assume the competing factions will figure something out. The silicon must flow, after all.

Data seems like the harder question. (Or at least the one I feel qualified talking about.)
We have already crossed the event horizon of trying to train on everything on the Internet.
It's increasingly difficult for labs to differentiate themselves on publicly available data.
Differentiation is instead coming from non-public high-quality data to augment public
low quality data.
The rumor is that GPT-4 is good at coding in part because
OpenAI spent a lot of time, effort, and money on acquiring good coding data. Adobe
[put out an ad asking for "500 to 1000 photos of bananas in real life situations"](https://petapixel.com/2023/10/04/adobe-wants-1000-photos-of-bananas-to-help-train-its-ai-image-generator/)
for their AI projects.
Anthropic has a dedicated ["tokens" team to acquire and understand data](https://www.builtinsf.com/job/operations/research-manager-tokens/158569), based on job listings.
Everyone wants good data, and they're willing to pay for it, because people trust
the models can use that data effectively as long as they can get it.

All the scaling laws have followed power laws so far, including dataset size. Getting
more data by hand doesn't seem good enough to cross to the next thresholds. We need better
means.

A long time ago, when OpenAI still did RL in games / simulation, they were very into [self-play](https://openai.com/research/competitive-self-play). You run agents against copies of themselves, score
their interactions, and update the models towards interactions with higher reward.
Given enough time, they learn complex strategies through competition.
At the time, I remember Ilya said they cared because self-play was a method to turn compute into
data. You run your model, get data from your model's interactions with the environment, funnel it back in, and get an exponential
improvement in your Elo curves. What was quickly clear was that this was true,
but only in the narrow regime where self-play was possible. In practice that usually meant
game-like environments, with at most a few hundred different entities, a ground truth reward function
that was not too easy or hard, and easy ability to reset and run faster than real time. Without
all those qualities, self-play sputtered and died with nothing to show for it besides
warmer GPUs.

I think it's possible we're at the start of a world where self-play or self-play-like ideas work on any text generation task. Drawing an analogy, the
environment is the dialogue, actions are text generated from an LLM, and the reward is from whatever
reward model you have. Instead of using ground truth data, our models may be at a point
where they can generated synthetic data that's good enough to train on.

There's a lot of interest in ideas along this vein.
One of the early results around GPT-4 by [Pan, Chan, Zou et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03279)
was that GPT-4's label accuracy was competitive with human crowdworkers.
Diffusion based
image augmentation has been shown to improve [robot learning](https://diffusion-rosie.github.io/),
and Anthropic has based a lot of its branding on [constitutional AI](https://www.anthropic.com/index/constitutional-ai-harmlessness-from-ai-feedback) and "RL from AI feedback".
NeurIPS had [a workshop](https://openreview.net/group?id=NeurIPS.cc/2023/Workshop/SyntheticData4ML#tab-accept-poster) on it too.

If the models don't eat their own tail, the end result is a world where data becomes
increasingly untethered from human effort, and progress just fully turns into how
many FLOPs you can shovel into the system.
A world where direct human feedback is only used to bootstrap reward models for new use
cases or sanity check data generated for existing ones.
Everything else is model-generated and model-supervised.
Model-generated data, model-based rewards, feeding back into itself.
Even if it the accuracy of synthetic labels is worse, it's often cheaper.

Back in 2016, people tried using GANs to generate data for image classification,
and showed it worked if you were in a low-data regime. [One of my first accepted papers](https://sites.google.com/view/graspgan) was on the subject. If "every image on the Internet" is now
a "low-data" regime, that doesn't mean people give up. It means they'll try to find a way.

Language models are a [blurry JPEG of the Internet](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/chatgpt-is-a-blurry-jpeg-of-the-web) now, but that is because we believed LLM text was bad
for training, so giving them the Internet was the best we could do.
What happens if that changes, and LLMs become blurry JPEGs of something clearer than we can imagine?


Search and Q\*
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I don't have too much to say about search, but I should mention it briefly.

During the Sam Altman drama, [Reuters reported](https://www.reuters.com/technology/sam-altmans-ouster-openai-was-precipitated-by-letter-board-about-ai-breakthrough-2023-11-22/)
a method called "Q\*", creating a lot of speculation. In the circles I was in, the
assumption was that it was some Q-learning driven search process, since it was named
similarly to [A\* search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithmhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm).
Eventually Yann LeCun put out a post saying people really needed to cool down, since
literally every lab has
looked into combining search with LLMs, and it would not be that surprising if someone made it work.

He was 100% correct. It is a very obvious idea to try. DeepMind put out a preprint that
[CNNs are good evaluators of Go moves](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6564) in December 2014, added search
via MCTS, and turned it into AlphaGo within a year. It was the ML success story of the decade.
People do not forget the lessons from machine learning's crowning achievements.

Search methods are usually very computationally inefficient, and I don't know if our base models
are good enough to use as search subroutines. But one benefit of search is that it really
ought to work. It is one of the most reliable ideas in machine learning. The reason we
use search less now is because we've come up with better ideas for how to use compute. Search
will always be there to eat marginal FLOPs if we run out of better ideas.
Think harder, then teach yourself to come up with your final result the first time.


How Believable is All This?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overall I think it's plausible that we'll continue to scale, that some of the perceived bottlenecks won't
matter, and we'll discover ways to use current models to widen the ones that do.
I'm finding it increasingly hard to refute that view of the world.

This theory of the world does rely heavily on model-generated data panning out.
It's possible that doesn't play out. Or, that it leads to some gains, but runs into
diminishing marginal returns.

Still, let me know when you *see* the scaling laws hit a wall, instead of talking about why they ought to stop. So far, I don't think they have.


The Bull and the Bears
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When getting feedback on early drafts of this post, the main lesson I learned is that
for AGI, there is one bull and many bears.
The bull is to say that we can fix the problems with scaling and doing so will fix the rest. The
bears are to declare X, Y, or Z as either fundamental blockers or reasons progress will slow down.
This makes it tricky to write a post about AGI timelines, because everyone's bear is
different.

![Bears](/public/ai-timelines-2023/bears.webp)

(Or one. I think it's totally fine to be bearish on AGI.)

I feel obligated to address as many bears as possible, but I also don't want this
post to become super long. So I'll try to be quick. If I don't mention your bear,
I apologize.

## Data Poisoning and Provenance

There are few papers exploring the idea of whether you could poison the Internet for model
training, by generating lots of content that you know will be bad for model training and spamming
it on commonly crawled sites.

The part I am really not sure about is how long that will be true, or how easy it will be to
make progress in a world where

My impression is that people outside robotics have a religion of disembodiment, and people in
robot learning have a religion of embodiment. Which has always left me a bit of an odd duck,
given that I work in robot learning but don't have much of an embodiment religion. I think it's very
obvious that robotics data should help with spatial understanding, and is inherently agentic in nature.
It is very non-obvious that embodiment is the only route towards more agentic goal-directed
systems. To me it feels like it is just one route out of many. (But see [alternative views hera](https://keerthanapg.com/tech/embodiment-agi/).)


On Hype
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In 2016, a few prominent ML researchers decided to pull a prank. They set up a site for
"Rocket AI", based on some mysterious method called "Temporally Recurrent Optimal Learning",
then all coordinated stories about a wild launch party at NeurIPS 2016 that ended with policy
involvement. It was all fake, as [detailed in this postmortem](https://medium.com/the-mission/rocket-ai-2016s-most-notorious-ai-launch-and-the-problem-with-ai-hype-d7908013f8c9).
There's a fun quote near the end:

> AI is at peak hype, and everyone in the community knows it.

Here's the Google search trends for "artificial intelligence" and "AI" since 2016. Both are scaled
out of 100, with 100 matching peak search interest. Let's see how peak 2016 hype compares to now.

![Artificial intelligence chart](/public/ai-timelines-2023/artificialsearchtrend.png)
{: .centered }

![AI chart](/public/ai-timelines-2023/aisearchtrend.png)
{: .centered }

Oh, what naive children we were! I do think it's funny that AI is one of only a few research topics
where people try to play down hype for the sake of the conversational commons. Imagine feeling like
you need to push people away from being interested in your research. There's a real privilege there.

I have really really tried to avoid getting caught up in hype, but I do think AGI could be soon.
The routes for improvement are clear, it's just a question of if they can't work or if they can work
assuming billions of dollars of funding.
In AI, models can **never** do everything people claim they can, but what the models **can** do is ever-growing
and never slides backward. Today is the worst AI will ever be. Even if all the VC companies bust and LLMs
dry up, we'll still have the models that are already trained and the ideas already derived. There is no going back.
I'd recommend people think about what that means.
