There are a few things they warn you about before you start writing a Mystery Hunt, but
one thing they don't warn you about is how much it will destroy your ability to make
small talk.

"What did you do this weekend?"

Me, internally: I worked a 10-hour shift painting strips of wood as part of a puzzle
construction assembly line.

Me: "Oh, not much."

I feel like every puzzle aficionado goes through at least one conversation where they try
to explain what puzzlehunts are, and why they're fun, and this conversation goes poorly.
Usually I end up saying they're like escape rooms, and this is sufficient for most people,
but in many ways puzzlehunts are *not* like escape rooms?
People do not excitedly edit a spreadsheet for 3 hours in any escape room I've been to.

Even if you are talking to someone who does puzzlehunts regularly, you can't talk about
Hunt with them very much, because you're trying to avoid spoilers! It turns into this
very weird *thing*, where a lot of people don't get it and you can't fully share your
work with people who do get it, not until the end. The act of puzzle writing has lots
of its payoff heavily concentrated at the end, and if that goes poorly, it can really
drain a lot of the fulfillment.

Even if you
So, there is 
Still,

So

My previous Mystery Hunt posts have just skipped over this question of "why puzzles?"
and assume that everyone reading is already onboard. However, the question of "why
write *your own* puzzle" is, I think, a lot more interesting and a lot more important.
So, those of you looking for just the details about Hunt: pardon the transgression.


Why Solve Puzzles?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well, because they're fun, that's why?

But, why are puzzles fun? I'm going to put on my machine learning researcher hat
for a bit, meaning I'm going to make wildly broad generalizations about cognition
that will make some people very angry.

In any puzzlehunt puzzle, you start with a bunch of data.
A list of clues, a small game, a bunch of images, whatever. The puzzle does not
directly tell you what to do with that data, but there is this guiding contract
between the puzzle setter and puzzle solver: "this puzzle has a solution".
Based on that contract, you work at the puzzle until you solve it, usually distilling
the data into an English word or phrase.

If the puzzle doesn't explain what to do, what does it even mean for it to have
a solution? Usually, what this means is that **there is exactly one explanation
for all the data**, that fits much better than every alternate one.

One way I've described puzzles is that they're like research projects, except you
know you can finish them in a few hours rather than a few months or years. I
suspect this is why programmers and professors are so overrepresented. The act
of debugging or doing research stretches a very similar muscle.

To put on my machine learning researcher hat for a bit, a puzzle is something
that compresses very well.
Discovering the compression algorithm (often called "breaking in" or "finding the a-ha")
is what triggers the dopamine rush that makes solvers want to keep doing
puzzles.

This gets at the core tension between solver and constructor. Puzzlehunts are special
because their solutions are not obvious. The solutions *have* to be indirect, because
you need to leave enough space for solvers to work with the puzzle and discover the
answer for themselves. If you don't give mental space, and railroad solvers from start
to finish, then it loses the reward - it's just following directions.

Or, put another way: if it's impossible to get completely lost, then it's not a puzzle,
but if it's possible to get completely lost, not everyone is going to get the full
experience.

Take the duck konundrum. It's literally a series of directions. They're hit-or-miss
as a puzzle type, but when they hit, it is usually because following the directions is
hard for some reason. What if we misread a line?
What if we have to start over? That tension is the chance for failure that makes a
puzzle a puzzle.
