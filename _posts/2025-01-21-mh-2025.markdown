*This has spoilers for MIT Mystery Hunt 2025. Spoilers are not labeled. I will add puzzle
links once there's a stable link to them.*

I feel like I have less time to write my yearly Mystery Hunt post than usual. I don't
actually have less time, there are no deadlines here, but last year I got my post out by
the 21st, before TTBNL's AMA. Meanwhile I am starting this post on the 21st, and Death & Mayhem have
already ran their AMA.
To spoil the answer to this puzzle, MLK day was 5 days later than it was in 2024, and Death & Mayhem
have been impressively on top of things, running their AMA within a few days of Hunt end.

This year's Hunt was really solid, I enjoyed it more than
their 2018 Hunt which is commonly cited as an all-timer. In part that's because I was remote in 2018, so I missed some of the physical puzzle nonsense from that year, but I do think the rounds
in 2025 rivaled some of the concepts from 2018. One of the hypest things you can do in a puzzlehunt
is backsolve a meta, so of course I would like the hunt where we backsolved 5 of them.

It did make me a little wistful about writing 2023's Mystery Hunt. A lot of 2023's writing goals
were to write something analogous to 2018 (fewer puzzles, more involved meta structures, go all-in on what teammate values). I know it's stupid and doesn't make sense, but throughout the weekend I
was thinking "dang, this is what could have been if we'd executed better".

During wrap-up, Death & Mayhem said they were "a little bit capital E Extra in everything we do", and, yes, that came through, it was great 10/10, very strong theater kid energy, like they had charged up 7 years of power level and went nuts once they got another chance to write Hunt.

High-Level Thoughts
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Hunt was won at a reasonable time (Sunday 11 AM, hooray!) I would actually prefer it getting pushed even more towards the shorter end, given that Cardinality was a few hours ahead of 2nd place.

The decision to give every team a radio was insane, very cool, and probably should not be repeated
unless your team has the requisite experience. I did not do any radio puzzles besides listening to
the weather (more on that later), but even during the weekend we broke our radio by just trying to charge it. We got it fixed pretty quickly, but at a high level glance it seemed like a huge headache to support.

The Gala made a lot of sense in-story, and I would echo that it was great to run into hunters from
other teams during the few times I visited. I'm not sure how many people it took to staff, but I would like something like it to come back.

Story-wise, I think it's just hard to tell a story within a puzzlehunt. You have much more success
if you instead focus on conveying a certain vibe or aesthetic, and then let that aesthetic carry
the plot for people interested in following that. In that respect I feel this hunt delivered the crime noir aesthetic really well.

The choose-your-own-adventure unlock system, I have mixed feelings about. Yes, it's neat that you
can do a bunch of strategizing, and choose whether you want to go all-in on one round or chip away at each individually. It is nice that every puzzle will get worked on to some extent, rather than the last feeder in a round getting shafted.
However, I feel it does require more diligence on the testsolving end. The open-world nature of Breath of the Wild was brought up as inspiration, but that invites the main criticism of Breath of the Wild: that in order to make every shrine a valid next shrine to attempt, all the shrines need to be "flat" in difficulty and complexity. There's not as much room for variance if it's possible for a team
to pick a puzzle that's harder than expected (looking at you, Do the Manual Calculations).

Personally, I thought the choose your own unlocks worked out a lot better than I expected them to.
It did make hunt ops go "oh no how do we handle this" though. (IDK, what am I trying to say here.)


Pre-Hunt
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our story begins with the Gala invitation.

IMAGE HERE

In previous years, teammate has tried to "solve" puzzles from pre-Hunt material.
Every time, it was not a puzzle. After doing this for 5 years, we've stopped
trying. The general thinking was that the Gala invitation was a puzzle, but it
wouldn't be solvable without shell from the main Hunt.

When we eventually did unlock the invitation puzzle, and found it had no shell,
we were surprised. But we had brought the invitation from where it was shipped,
so we didn't have to print it and solved it from the original. Supposedly
Cardinality partly pre-solved the puzzle because "teammate is definitely going to pre-solve it and if we don't we'll be behind". Sorry to let you down? Embarassingly this
also meant we failed to pre-solve the Dan Katz Puzzle Corner.

Ignoring the puzzles for a bit (shocker), it recommended showing up to the
event in cocktail attire. This was *very* convenient for me, since I was
attending a wedding in the area before Hunt. (The couple specifically picked the
week before Hunt because many of their friends are puzzle people.) That made it
incredibly low effort to show up to kick-off dressed up, although teammate did
do a group order of bowties. (Did you know you can buy boxes of 40 bowties for
$25? It was surprisingly cheap to follow through.)

I did have to figure out how to get my blazer to Boston without wrinkling it
in my carry-on. The solution was to be *stylish* and wear it on the plane there
and back.

In my free time pre-Hunt, I went to Puzzled Pint, where I tried to all-brain
a logic puzzle (solve it without writing anything). This failed miserably and I
went back to using pencil like a normal person.



Friday
-------------------------------------------------------------

After kickoff finished, we went to our on-campus classroom to read the radio and
how the key system worked.

The first reaction of our hunt ops crew was "this is going to be a disaster",
because at first glance the keys were going to create *so many decisions* and
make controlling round prioritization a mess. They immediately first asked that
no one outside hunt ops use any keys, then spent the start of Hunt figuring out
what system to use.

Eventually, they landed on this:
* Whenever a new puzzle was discovered, a Discord alert would be fired by our
Hunt management software.
* Team members asynchronously vote on puzzles they wanted to work on, only voting
on puzzles where they would actually work on it (rather than watch other people
work on it).
* Hunt ops would spend keys based on the votes. Round prioritization overrode
votes, but votes within a round would be helpful.
* Hunt ops would convert 1 clue to keys then keep the rest to push the final
metas.

The last was decided on the latest and was by far the most controversial. As we
went through the Hunt, exciting sounding puzzles would sit there, being
unlockable if we cashed in the clue we had. This got worse when Hunt ops
decided to stockpile 3 keys after the Illegal Search meta was unlocked.
The reason they did so was because they strongly suspected more puzzles were
gated behind Papa's Bookcase (because of course there should be a hidden room
behind the books of an escape room). So they wanted to make sure puzzles could
be unlocked once the meta was solved - but this

they would unlock more puzzles after solving the
they strongly suspected more puzzles would
unlock

Hunt ops believed teammate didn't need more than a width of 12 puzzles to productively
make progress, and wanted to reserve some nukes for endgame in case we were in danger of not finishing.

teammate historically has a hunt ops team, and if there is drama, it usually comes
downstream of hunt strategy decisions.
