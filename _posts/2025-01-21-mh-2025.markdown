*This has spoilers for MIT Mystery Hunt 2025. Spoilers are not labeled. I will add puzzle
links once there's a stable link to them.*

This year, I feel like I have less time to write my Mystery Hunt post than usual. I don't
actually have less time, there are no deadlines here, but last year I got my post done before
TTBNL's AMA, and I only *started* on this post by the time Death & Mayhem did theirs.

To spoil the answer to this puzzle, Death & Mayhem
have been impressively on top of things, hosting their AMA the Wednesday after Hunt, and that
was just a running theme.
This year's Hunt was really solid, I enjoyed it more than their 2018 Hunt,
which is commonly cited as an all-time good Mystery Hunt. In part that's because I was remote in 2018, so I missed all the in-person energy from that year, but I do think the rounds from
2025 rivaled some of the concepts from 2018.
One of the hypest things you can do in a puzzlehunt
is backsolve a meta, so of course I would like the hunt where we backsolved five of them.
(And they weren't even all Shell metas!)

It did make me a little wistful about writing 2023's Mystery Hunt. A lot of 2023's writing goals
were to write something analogous to 2018 (fewer puzzles, weird and difficult metas, go all-in on what teammate values, scale down puzzle count). I know it's stupid and doesn't make sense, but throughout the weekend I
was thinking "dang, this is what could have been if we'd executed better".

During wrap-up, Death & Mayhem said they were "a little bit capital E Extra in everything we do", and, yes, that came through. It was great, 10/10, very strong theater kid energy, like Death & Mayhem had charged up 7 years of power level and went nuts once they got to write Hunt again.

High-Level Thoughts
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Hunt was won at a reasonable time. Sunday 11:47 AM, hooray! That being said, it still felt long
because Cardinality won so far ahead of everyone else. Would definitely have preferred Hunt go shorter
by another few hours, but can't complain too much.

The decision to give every team a radio was insane, very cool, and probably should not be repeated
unless your team has the requisite experience. I did not do any radio puzzles besides listening to
the weather (more on that later), but we did break our radio when we plugged it into charging
while the radio was still on. We got it fixed, but it was indicative of how much of a headache
it looked like to support.

The Gala made a lot of sense in-story, and I would echo that it was great to run into hunters from
other teams during the few times I visited. I'm not sure how many people it took to staff, but I would like something similar to come back.

Story-wise, I think it's just hard to tell a story within a puzzlehunt. You have much more success
if you instead focus on conveying a certain vibe or aesthetic, and then let that aesthetic carry
the plot for people interested in the story. In that respect, I feel this hunt delivered the crime noir aesthetic really well, even if I didn't fully remember everyone's name or secret.

And now....

Choose-Your-Own-Adventure
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I think if you want to do a choose-your-own adventure unlock system. this Hunt was a good
implementation of it, and showcased its strengths. The choices are informed, and it enables a
lot of strategizing on whether to go all-in on one round or spread out. It is much more likely
that every puzzle is worked on by many teams, rather than the final feeders in unlock order
getting shafted.

The open-world nature of Breath of the Wild was brought up as inspiration, but that invites the main criticism of Breath of the Wild: in order to make every shrine a valid next shrine to attempt,
most shrines need to be flat in difficulty, complexity, and reward. This was less true for
puzzles, where the value of a round feeder can shift, and sometimes you open
a puzzle that's harder than expected (looking at you, Do the Manual Calculations).

I had a lot of fun with the choose your own unlocks. I am not sure if our
hunt ops team felt the same way? To borrow a metaphor from Defunctland's FastPass video,
some people enjoy meticulously *planning* their trip to Disney World, and some people just
want to *go* to Disney World. My experience was much closer to the "go to Disney World" side.
I saw puzzles get unlocked, with no idea what round they were in, and I just worked on them,
because I assumed hunt ops was only unlocking puzzles that helped Hunt progression.
Meanwhile, the first reaction of our hunt ops to the
keys was "this is going to be a disaster", since it added lots of tiny decisions on top of their
existing large scale decisions.

The eventual teammate key system was this:

* Hunt ops owns all the keys and clues. No one else gets to use them unless hunt ops says it's okay.
* The manager of our Hunt management system modified their bot to send a Discord alert
whenever we revealed a new puzzle.
* Team members asynchronously vote on puzzles they want to work on, where a vote means
you will actually work on it, rather than want to watch other people work on it.
* Keys will be spent based on votes made, taking round prioritization into account. Ping hunt
ops if keys haven't been used in a while.
* Hunt ops planned to convert the 1st clue to keys, then reassess.

This was all pretty uncontroversial. Where it got controversial was when we got out 2nd clue,
ops did a discussion, and declared that we would be saving all future clues for endgame puzzles.
As we progressed through the Hunt, exciting sounding puzzles would sit there, being
unlockable if we cashed in clues. This was exacerbated when hunt ops decided to stockpile
3 keys after the Illegal Search meta was unlocked.
The reason they did so was because they strongly suspected more puzzles were
gated behind Papa's Bookcase ("clearly the bookcase of an escape room will hide another room").
They wanted to make sure that if puzzles were gated behind the bookcase, they could immediately
unlock them to avoid stalling out the round. This was a correct prediction, and getting an instant
3 unlocks post-Bookcase definitely contributed to us doing well this Hunt. The one problem was
that they didn't tell everybody this was the plan. So a number of people saw that we had 3 keys,
and weren't using them, when hype sounding puzzles like The 10000-Sheet Excel File weren't
getting unlocked...

Personally, I never felt like I ran out of puzzles to work on. There was always something in motion
that I could contribute to. However, I did notice that we never really had a puzzle that sat untouched
for a long time, like I'd seen in past Mystery Hunts. Based on asking other teams, teammate was
on the low end for clue to key conversion. We converted 1, Cardinality converted 2,
Galactic converted 3 and regretted converting the 3rd, UE converted 3 and also regretted it,
Providence converted 3 and *didn't* regret it, TSBI converted 3, Setec converted 4.
It worked out for us, but I can totally see how it may have been more fun to just unlock all the
things.


Pre-Hunt
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our story begins with the Gala invitation.

IMAGE HERE

In previous years, teammate has tried to "solve" puzzles from pre-Hunt material.
Every time, it was not a puzzle. After doing this for 5 years, we've stopped
trying. The general thinking was that the Gala invitation was a puzzle, but it
wouldn't be solvable without shell from the main Hunt.

When we eventually did unlock the invitation puzzle, and found it had no shell,
we were surprised. But we had brought the invitation from where it was shipped,
so we didn't have to print it and solved it from the original. Supposedly
Cardinality partly pre-solved the puzzle because "teammate is definitely going to pre-solve it and if we don't we'll be behind". Sorry to let you down? Embarassingly this
also meant we failed to pre-solve the Dan Katz Puzzle Corner.

Ignoring the puzzles for a bit (shocker), it recommended showing up to the
event in cocktail attire. This was *very* convenient for me, since I was
attending a wedding in the area before Hunt. (The couple specifically picked the
week before Hunt because many of their friends are puzzle people.) That made it
incredibly low effort to show up to kick-off dressed up, although teammate did
do a group order of bowties. (Did you know you can buy boxes of 40 bowties for
$25? It was surprisingly cheap to follow through.)

BOWTIE IMAGE

I did have to figure out how to get my blazer to Boston without wrinkling it
in my carry-on. The solution was to be *stylish* and wear it on the plane there
and back.

In my free time pre-Hunt, I went to Puzzled Pint, where I tried to all-brain
a logic puzzle (solve it without writing anything), and got involved in a heated argument
about vegetables in the teammate Discord. It is not worth re-litigating, but
my takeaways are that eating salads is a bad way to be vegetarian, people like vegetables
more if they're cooked (shocker), and "screw zodiac signs, [what vegetable are you?](https://sophie006liu.github.io/vegetal/)"

![Pho](/public/mh-2025/pho.png)
{: .centered }


Friday
-------------------------------------------------------------

After kickoff finished, we went to our on-campus classroom to read the radio and
how the key system worked.

The first reaction of our hunt ops crew was "this is going to be a disaster",
because at first glance the keys were going to create *so many decisions* and
make controlling round prioritization a mess. They immediately first asked that
no one outside hunt ops use any keys, then spent the start of Hunt figuring out
what system to use.

Eventually, they landed on this:
* Whenever a new puzzle was discovered, a Discord alert would be fired by our
Hunt management software.
* Team members asynchronously vote on puzzles they wanted to work on, only voting
on puzzles where they would actually work on it (rather than watch other people
work on it).
* Hunt ops would spend keys based on the votes. Round prioritization overrode
votes, but votes within a round would be helpful.
* Hunt ops would convert 1 clue to keys then keep the rest to push the final
metas.

The last was decided on the latest and was by far the most controversial. As we
went through the Hunt, exciting sounding puzzles would sit there, being
unlockable if we cashed in the clue we had. This got worse when hunt ops
decided to stockpile 3 keys after the Illegal Search meta was unlocked.
The reason they did so was because they strongly suspected more puzzles were
gated behind Papa's Bookcase ("clearly there is a hidden room behind this bookcase").
They wanted to make sure those puzzles could be unlocked once the meta was solved. This
was a correct prediction, but they didn't tell everyone this was the plan,
so a bunch of us just saw 3 keys that weren't getting used...

I never felt like I ran out of puzzles to work on, but I did notice that we never really
had a puzzle that had sat untouched for a long time like I'd seen in past Mystery Hunts.
Based on informal polling,

* teammate turned 1 clue into keys
* Cardinality turned 2 clues into keys
* Galactic turned 3 clues in keys, but in retrospect regretted this and would have preferred
using 2 keys.
* Providence turned 3 clues into keys, and didn't regret it.
* TSBI turned 2 clues into keys.
* UE turned 3 clues into keys, and regretted it, saying they overestimated progress from
Stakeout puzzles
* Setec Astornomy turned 4 clues into keys

So we were definitely on the low end.

Puzzles touched:

## Missing Diamond

[**XOXO**](https://www.two-pi-noir.agency/puzzles/xoxo) - This was our first solve of the Hunt (hooray for the Activity Log to make checking this easy). I will always be proud that we outraced the logic puzzlers working on [Unreal Islands](https://www.two-pi-noir.agency/puzzles/unreal_islands). I identified two pairs then focused on transcribing pairs into the grid.

[**Downright Backwards**](https://www.two-pi-noir.agency/puzzles/downright_backwards) - By the time I got to this puzzle, the entire grid had been filled out, and my one contribution was asking if
we should try the opposite interpretation of the z-direction (which was correct).

[**Battle Factory**](https://www.two-pi-noir.agency/puzzles/battle_factory) - I have been watching
some Gen III Battle Factory speedruns recently, and luckily this puzzle got solved faster than those
speedruns. This is a cute idea, I'm surprised I haven't seen it before.

[**📑🍝**](https://www.two-pi-noir.agency/puzzles/%F0%9F%93%91%F0%9F%8D%9D) - I did not work on this puzzle, but got many confusing messages from friends until I understood why they were sending them.
This ended up being an interesting litmus test for seeing how other teams were doing, based on when
the 🍝 request came in.

[**🔎🧊**](https://www.two-pi-noir.agency/puzzles/%F0%9F%94%8E%F0%9F%A7%8A) - A little annoyed with the final extraction step of this puzzle (really wanted it to be only adjacent letters, rather than any pair), but I liked everything before it.
This was the first puzzle I did coding for, to brute force finding the words. There was a clean way
to implement it, and the way I did it (7 nested for loops).

[**Zing it Again**](https://www.two-pi-noir.agency/puzzles/zing_it_again) - The first set we found
was Weird Al (as expected). We found the Bob's Burgers set pretty soon afterwards, but could not find
the HM set for a *long* time. I was pretty happy about breaking into that one, definitely enjoyed the B-B-B-BAD TO THE CHROME rebus.

[**The Boardwalk**](https://www.two-pi-noir.agency/puzzles/the_boardwalk) - I decided to work on most of the metas in Missing Diamond, because, well, I like working on metas. I didn't come up with
any of the extraction ideas for this meta, instead I did more advocating that the ideas others proposed were correct.
It did take us an embarrassing amount of time to find THE BEATLES space, because we didn't realize The Beatles Collectors Edition could have a space for THE BEATLES. We also expected letters to get extracted from the other half of the board. Luckily one person decided to submit the letters we'd extracted from the 5/5 feeders we had instead of speculating on what more feeders we'd get.

Also, I don't think anyone else has mentioned this: it's kinda insane Death & Mayhem implemented 3 minigames for the Boardwalk interaction just for the story? Like, what? I tapped into my God Gamer genes and won all of them. They don't seem to be replayable, hope they make it to the archive!

[**The Jewelry Store**](https://www.two-pi-noir.agency/puzzles/the_jewelry_store) - The meta crew next looked at The Jewelry Store, breaking in on the idea pretty quickly. Interestingly, when we broke in, we had 5/7 feeders and all the feeders we did have were adjacent in the chain. That was pretty unlikely (about 1/6th if I'm doing the math right), and hurt the wheel of fortune attempts, we needed a 6th feeder to solve it. I thought the backsolve would be pretty easy, but the constraints were surprisingly loose and we ended up forward solving our final feeder.

[**The Art Gallery**](https://www.two-pi-noir.agency/puzzles/the_art_gallery) - When I started looked at this meta, we'd already IDed the Crayola and RGB steps. Another teammate did a sort by length,
and I noticed the UNICODES partial. From there it still took us a while. I refuse to believe there's a good canonical source for this, we tried both Wikipedia and the Crayola fandom page and they gave conflicting data. At one point, I decided the most canonical source would be to use
an eyedropper tool on colors from the crayola.com website, but then that was inconsistent too! Our solve came from putting all the options into different tabs of our sheet and squinting until an answer came out.

(Aside: for the Art Gallery interaction, we were asked to investigate Papa's secret, which was in either his wallet, his office, his car, or his study. It was set up as a force, where only one option would progress the story, and I know this because we voted for every other option first. I want it on the record that I voted for study every time, rest of teammate be wack, *who keeps their deepest secrets in their car how did that win the vote.*)

[**On the Corner**](https://www.two-pi-noir.agency/puzzles/on_the_corner) - We knew this puzzle went to Art Gallery, which we'd already solved, and we attempted a number of backsolves to free up the key. These backsolves failed, and eventually we said "how hard can it be to forward solve a puzzle?"
My contribution was 1) working on the Tech Corner puzzles and 2) not noticing that all 4 Tech Corner puzzles had already been solved in another tab.
I assumed Dan Katz was in on it and it's *so funny* he wasn't.

[**The Casino**](https://www.two-pi-noir.agency/puzzles/the_casino) - We were down to our final Missing Diamond meta. I noticed all our feeders contained a card value, started with a suit letter (C/D/H/S), and ended with a suit letter (C/D/H/S). From this, we concluded that each answer defined two hole cards. One was the number + suit from the last letter. The second was an undetermined number + suit of first letter, and we would find that number based on what worked for the given hands.

Now, that's not exactly how the meta works...we had 5/7 feeders and it *just so happened* that we were missing the two feeders that would have broken the pattern. After failing to solve, we decided
to go get another feeder.

[**Be Kind, Rewind**](https://www.two-pi-noir.agency/puzzles/be_kind_rewind) - This puzzle definitely reminded me of the similar one from Puzzle University, but that puzzle was fun and so was this one.
I was originally drawn to this puzzle for the movie ID, but then it turned into more than that.
Luckily, everyone working on the puzzle knew what Blockbuster was. I don't need to feel any older from Mystery Hunt.

[**The Casino, Revisited**] - Now that we had an answer breaking the pattern, we thought more about how to use the cards. Looking at the most constrained hand (10♠/A♠ or 9♠/10♠), I noticed we both of 10♠ and A♠ in our answers, and had no diamonds (which made it much easier to find a unique winning hand for the 1st hand, which we'd originally filled in as a flush.) From there we solved pretty quickly,
and backsolved No Notes to clean up the round. At wrap-up, we wondered why our team wasn't in the team photo montage, and that would be because we backsolved the submission puzzle for it. Oops.

[**The Thief**] - Paraphrased story of our solve: Two people go to the Gala with the radio, returning an hour later.

"Yeah, we've followed the entire path but don't really know what to do with it."

"You know about the grid on the round page and all the witness statements we've been collecting in the spreadsheet, right?"

"...What?"


## Stakeout

I spent most of my Hunt working on the tougher, meatier puzzles, so I did not spend much time in the
Stakeout round. We did deliberately keep the width in Stakeout low (around 1-2 until meta unlock, then 0
until Chinatown said they needed the help. I joked that we were practicing sustainable fishing.

[**The Ultimate Insult**](https://www.two-pi-noir.agency/puzzles/the_ultimate_insult) - Man, I opened this puzzle a few minutes after it had unlocked and it was already done. I'd like to think our 6 minute solve was the fastest, but I bet some other video gaming team did it in 5.

[**Fight Night at Mo's**](https://www.two-pi-noir.agency/puzzles/fight_night_at_mos) - This puzzle felt a little weird. Once we broke in. we started unrolling the bracket, but then realized all the extraction notes were either in round 1 or the finals, meaning you could ignore almost all the matches. I initially thought this would be about Moe's Tavern, but nope, that was a different puzzle.

[**Control Room**](https://www.two-pi-noir.agency/puzzles/control_room) - I stopped by this puzzle to
spectate the madness. I think our player was especially willing to fork the outlet, since we had several other tasks by then. We assumed "rotate the camera" was going to be meaner than it was (rotate our camera view by 180 degrees and force us to give directions from an upside-down camera feed.)

[**Some Assembly Required**](https://www.two-pi-noir.agency/puzzles/some_assembly_required) - I see we've continued the meme of having a puzzle named "Some Assembly Required", carried over from 2023 and 2024. I'm looking forward to solving "No Assembly Required" in Mystery Hunt 2026, where the puzzle gives you the answer for no work.


## Background Check

[**He Shouldn't Have Eaten The Apple**](https://www.two-pi-noir.agency/puzzles/he_shouldnt_have_eaten_the_apple) - When solving this puzzle, the first location we IDed was [Adam's Peak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam%27s_Peak), which inspired many Adam conspiracies, like trying to make [Tomb of Adham Khan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomb_of_Adham_Khan) work. We eventually got out of this rabbit hole by finding the UNESCO step. We skipped the step of putting the locations on the map,
by guessing the correct sort order for the last step.
I will say, it took us a long time to get the joke of "they are all ruins", it felt pretty unmotivated before that and only tenuously motivated after that. Still, if you have an in with Adam Conover, you gotta use it.

[**The Tunnels Beneath the Institute**](https://www.two-pi-noir.agency/puzzles/the_tunnels_beneath_the_institute) - This was, just, like, the weirdest dataset. Finding the AC Installation Tutorial
genuinely broke me. We did not go far enough to get to the central a-ha, as I was instead baiting into searching
a different cursed dataset from...

[**Story Vision Contest**](https://www.two-pi-noir.agency/puzzles/story_vision_contest) - This puzzle was pretty fun, it's surprising how much overlap there is between the two datasets. "Surely this text about doing chores is from the fairytale half - NOPE here's a video of a dancer sensuously churning butter." We sped up
a lot of the song ID by guessing the puzzle would use the most famous or popular performances from each country, which was true pretty often.
The motif IDing afterward did get less fun, but we got through it before it became too tiring.

[**Alias**](https://www.two-pi-noir.agency/puzzles/alias) - I didn't do anything for this metameta, I just wanted to mention that
teammate backsolved The Mark, then guessed the correct metameta pun from 2/3 pieces on the first try. Background Check
meta team was cracked.

## Illegal Escape

I didn't really understand the gimmick of this round for a while, and by the time I did all the operations
had been applied. It's a cool concept for a round, but during Hunt you only
have time to see so much, and I decided to punt this to "check it out later".

[**(A Puzzle of the Dead)**](https://www.two-pi-noir.agency/puzzles/a_puzzle_of_the_dead) - This puzzle
was annoying to transcribe data for, but quite solid all the way through. The annoying part of the data
transcription was after understanding what was going on, but before we had all the data. Each section
takes 40 seconds to display, so there's a lot of waiting. We translated the
1st and 3rd sections independently. Once we got the message for the first destruction's encoding,
I failed to find the online decoder for it, so my solve was spent understanding a jank Python
implementation I found online. "What could go wrong with executing arbitrary code from the Internt?"

Once we got to the rhyme scheme step, I suggested that it could work like [Reflections on a Milky Steed Who's Quite Amphibious, Indeed](https://puzzles.mit.edu/2009/puzzles/reflections_on_a_milky_steed_whos_quite_amphibious_indeed/PUZZLE/). With
the note that "15 years is long enough to reuse an idea", two of us put in the letters, getting
excited that we'd hit exactly 26 rhymes. Unfortunately, we had some data errors. We flailed
until the Saturday 1 AM cutoff, and I took a look in my hotel room for a bit before abandoning
the puzzle. It got solved the next morning when someone checked our work. It's not until I read the
author's notes that I realized the poems were constrained to not use the letters U or O, which sounds
so painful to construct.

[**Jargon**](https://www.two-pi-noir.agency/puzzles/jargon) - I was working on A Map and a Shade (or Four) when this puzzle got released, and literally everyone at my table said "LINGO PUZZLE" and
left me to the geography wolves.
I decided I could not defeat the geography wolves on my own, and bravely retreated to Jargon
as well. This got started by like 10 people simultaneously - most of my contribution was repeatedly
pinging people to come to our table instead, since we'd had the most progress and relaying
info in the sheet was way less efficient than crowding around 1 computer.

[**Jargon (Blacklight)**](https://www.two-pi-noir.agency/puzzles/jargon_blacklight) - They left me to the wolves again!!! At least this time the detour was short.


## Paper Trail

Of the later rounds, I spent the most time on this one, both on feeders and the metas.

[**Do The Manual Calculations (Don't Try Monte Carlo)**](https://www.two-pi-noir.agency/puzzles/do_the_manual_calculations_dont_try_monte_carlo) - I ran
far, far away from this puzzle. We filled up two blackboards with calcuations, getting to the
CORRECT partial on Friday 4:40 PM and not solving it until Saturday 1:50 PM. Long story short,
they made a mistake on an earlier board that still extracted the correct letter for the
CORRECT checksum, so much of Friday was spent not understanding why the final grid did not make
sense.

IMAGE

[**World's Largest Crossword Puzzle**](https://www.two-pi-noir.agency/puzzles/worlds_largest_crossword_puzzle) - Author of
[World's Largest Logic Puzzle](https://puzzles.mit.edu/2023/puzzlefactory.place/puzzles/worlds-largest-logic-puzzle): "I feel like
if I don't work on this puzzle, I will have committed a crime".

My contributions were 1) pointing out the clues for "Zero" and
"One" were bolded, clearly indicating the input, and 2) solving both clues incorrectly with NULLED and UNIQUE, making my
contribution worse than useless. At some point during the solve, the author of WLLP shot down an idea saying
"It can't be that, because when I tried constructing that idea it was impossible to make it work". teammate solved this
in 2 hours, and I am pretty confident that will be fastest solve once more detailed stats are out.


[**Follow the Rules**](https://www.two-pi-noir.agency/puzzles/follow_the_rules) - I jumped onto this puzzle because I had just come
off doing a bunch of research puzzles and wanted to poke a black box. We got 7 of the rules, but couldn't find
a consistent explanation for the last 2. To handle this, one of us wrote a brute forcer, since $$3^9$$ is really not
that many options. Ignoring the two missing rules, there were 38 solutions, so the four of us started trying solutions to narrow
down the options. Then one person "oh, I got it" immediately after we split up. They had randomly picked the 1 correct solution
for their first attempt. This was sketchy enough that we then tested another 15 solutions, in case there was more than 1 valid
setting. There wasn't, the solution was unique and they were just insanely lucky.

One person on the team then proposed using the brute forcer to generate all the trigram constraints for the revealed extraction,
assuming it worked from ternary. They noted the original puzzle extracted CAL and were adamant that the next would extract LIN
and so forth. I thought this would be too messy to do (you'd get 40 trigrams per set), but then LIN was in the 2nd set and
continuing this way definitely faster than trying to figure out the last two rules.

[**Star Crossed**](https://www.two-pi-noir.agency/puzzles/star_crossed) - We got through the first step of the puzzle
without too much issue, although we were stuck on "SHTBYELEVEN" for a bit, trying to turn it into a final cluephrase (SHOT BY?).
One person said "this can't just be a word search, that would be lame", and I realized it might be "SHIFT BY" instead.
That was confirmed by the answer checker, so we kept going.

I think the policy on confirming partials has become more lenient over years of Mystery Hunt. This may partly be because
of the shift to automated answer checking, but it's also likely driven by broad trends in escape rooms, where rooms
have moved from advertising their low finish % to advertising how fun they are. People prefer confirmation on their
partial progress more than the abstract idea of only submitting answers when you are confident you are done.

With the partial confirmed, we did the shift, did the next step, got the "find names of Venus" message, and then got stuck.
The only names we'd be able to find were ISHTAR and VESPER. Although we suspected the puzzle would continue to only use
6-long names of Venus, we had trouble finding more compelling ones. In a bid to try to make APHRODITE work, I created a
conditional formatting version of the grid with APHRODITE letters colored, which was...not so helpful.

![Star Crossed grid with bad formatting](/public/mh-2025/starcrossed.png)
{: .centered }

We abandoned the puzzle, with notes that we just needed more names of Venus, and it got picked up + solved by some other team members a few horus later.

[**A Weathered Note**](https://www.two-pi-noir.agency/puzzles/a_weathered_note) - Throughout hunt, we had noted the weather reports coming in, but we had done a really half-assed job of tracking the data. I was pretty hype to finally use the weather data, but was stymied by the low quality of our transcriptions.
This turned the start of the puzzle into the world's goofiest Pomodoro - 25 minutes of research about
weather telegram codes from the late 1880s, then short breaks to transcribe the weather.
Every time the weather came in, we would shout "WEATHER!" to get the room to be quiet. Unfortunately, there were 2 rooms, and
the puzzle solve jingle was louder than the weather broadcast...

![Better alt text](/public/mh-2025/weather.png)
{: .centered }

Fortunately (unfortunately?), the time it took us to find and understand the 1887 War Department Weather
Code meant we were never bottlenecked on weather reports. We were bottlenecked on what you'd call
a "skill issue", we did not figure out the correct interpretation of "retiring after this
last transmission" and kept trying to use rivers instead of the correct idea. When the
Shell Corporations got unlocked soon after we got stuck, I abandoned the weather puzzle in favor of
metas.

[**Shell Corporations**] - These were definitely the highlight of the round. Soon after we unlocked
them, D&M came by doing a team check-up, asking about our meta progress in particular. We jokingly
asked if we could hear the weather in Los Angeles. "We'll pay you triple your pay!" "Well, I got paid $0, so this isn't a good deal." Meta-wise, at this point we had newly unlocked Shells, had some
grinding ID work done on The Killer, had solved 1/3 metas in Background Check, and good progress
on Papa's Bookcase.

> "Tell me about what you have on the meta."
> "We have...54 PDFs."

The people working on The Killer debated what they could ask about their work,
but we were quickly told that we were absolutely not getting hints on anything,
which let us know we were doing well.

Our path through the shells went as designed. We solved Shell 1 forward, slowly building backsolve
constraints on PENROSE. We solved Shell 3 with 0 feeders via brute-forcing the last step,
using that to figure out how the feeders worked. I didn't like the feeder mechanism, calling it jank,
but then I remember how jank some of the submets of Sci-Fi Round and Pokemon Round were and let it go.
From there, we were stuck, and bounced between guesses like "there's a backsolved feeder we don't have like Safari", "every puzzle is used in exactly 2 metas", and so on. Although we'd broken into
the idea for Shell 6, all our partial work was wrong due to making an early guess on RANGE that proved to be incorrect, and I spent my Sunday 2 AM trying to construct more cryptics without much luck.

The next morning, we got a call saying we could ask for hints on puzzles if we went to the Gala.
Hunt ops says this was because Cardinality was about to finish (they had seen their entire team in the
Gala). I took the opportunity to get A Weathered Note past the finish line, hoping the extra answer would unstick Shells. It didn't for the metas I was working on, but when we showed them to fresh eyes,
they asked a pivotal question: shouldn't shell corporations contain other shell corporations?

By this point, we had organized our HQ into two rooms. One room was "The Shells room", and the other was "the everything else room". Each table was working on a different set of shells, with my table
working on Shells 4 and 7. We had the a-ha that Shell 3's answer would be excellent for Shell 4,
and asked across the room if anyone else's shell wanted to use Shell 1's answer. The table for
Shell 2 said it could work for them, and you could feel the energy in the room spike up.
We backsolved Shell 7, re-forward solved it, used it to backsolve Shell 4, and then the room became
very loud as everyone shouted constraints they wanted and potential backsolve answers.
Our remaining solve path was a backsolve of Shell 6, a side-solve of Shell 2, a forward solve of Shell 8, and a partial forward solve of Shell 5 (enough to understand the feeders it used). Then a backsolve of Shell 5 finished faster than the forward solve, unlocking Shell Game. (We never figured out Shell 4 extract.)

[**The Shell Game**](https://www.two-pi-noir.agency/puzzles/the_shell_game) - The majority of the Shells room was asked to finish forward solving Shell 6 to resolve the graph, while a smaller group of around 8
worked on the metameta mechanics and checked past work. I verified that yes, that shell does go to itself, we'd put it in as
a "fuck it we ball" placeholder and I upgraded it to "yes we do ball".

The rough idea from the mechanics team was to draw paths using our feeders, but the edge counts weren't exactly lining up (the number of unique letters was a bit off in an unhelpful way). To fix
this, our team tried to make it work by using feeder answer letters out of order, which felt unsatisfying to me but I wasn't sure what else to do.
As Shell 6 got cleaned up (including the "what the fuck" update to our graph), I volunteered to go to the Gala to verify we weren't totally off track. It was around 5 PM by this point, hints were free-for-all, and we extra wanted to make sure we hit runaround before 10 PM.

On the way over, I ran into a huge contingent of Providence solvers in the hallway, and reported that Providence was likely on runaround.
At the Gala, I got confirmation that our graph was correct, and that our idea was mostly correct, with
a nudge to "consider the entire corporate structure". This was *just* big enough for
me to get the correct idea through Discord, and by the time I got back, there was only chaos.
The Killer had been solved in the interim, so everyone was in the Shells room. There were 4 copies
of the puzzle getting solved (2 on whiteboards, 2 online), each racing / acting as backup in case
one copy hit a contradiction. With all feeders for Paper Trail solved or bought with clues, there
wasn't really anything to do besides aspirational nutrimatic guesses and waiting, with a final solvea bit past 6 PM.

We got scheduled for a 7 PM run of endgame, and to celebrate we mass-unlocked all our remaining Stakeout puzzles. I contributed a bit to [Men's at My Nose](https://www.two-pi-noir.agency/puzzles/mens_at_my_nose), but mostly helped on cleaning up our HQ.

## Murder in MITropolis

[**Give This Grid a Shake**](https://www.two-pi-noir.agency/puzzles/give_this_grid_a_shake) - As we
solved the crossword clues, I looked in my folder of past puzzlehunting scripts, and found a file
called `boggle_bash.py`. While the other few people worked on building the Boggle board, I decided
to read this file to see if I could understand my old code enough to reuse it. I figured out
where to put the constraints, and my code output the final grid after 25 seconds of crunching. I
was told I absolutely had to tell this story in my blog post, so there you go.
(The epilogue no one else knows is that I tried to modify it to solve the full 6x6 board too, but they handsolved the 6x6 before I could make all the necessary changes.)

As for where the script
came from? I had written this to try to solve a Boggle meta in a puzzlehunt 4 years ago.
That meta wasn't actually a Boggle meta and used an entirely different mechanism.
I'm glad it was useful 4 years later!

[**We Can Do This All Day**](https://www.two-pi-noir.agency/puzzles/we_can_do_this_all_day) - It was
not until wrap-up that I learned this was not intended to be the obligatory scavenger hunt,
and before then I'd discussed it with a teammate as an interesting innovation on how
to make the scavenger hunt less grindy, while maintaing the seat-of-your-pants bullshitting that
makes it fun. I am overall ambivalent on the
scavenger hunt, I think it's fun but is always fighting the tightrope of taking too much
time to prepare entries for. We solved this by prerecording each task at multiple locations
before calling D&M for our 2nd attempt.

[**esTIMation dot jpg**](https://www.two-pi-noir.agency/puzzles/estimation_dot_jpg) - This was an interesting puzzle to break in on at Saturday 1:30 AM. Let me back up a bit: we'd sent 2 groups
to esTIMation, one at 11 PM and one at midnight. Our first group got wrecked due to lack of MIT
knowledge (and also because it was the first group and they didn't know what to expect). Our
second group did better. They also said the Friday midnight esTIMation was *incredibly* lit - someone
got engaged 15 minutes beforehand? Wild. I broke in on two image IDs at 1:30 AM, and I learned
sending a lot of wild searches at Google is something you can do on any amount of sleep, because
I was attempting searches for the next hour before deciding to go to bed. The esTIMation events
at 8 AM and 9 AM were considerably more dead. We successfully nutrimaticed the answer from 6/17 answers
right before 10 AM.

[**Engagements and Other Crimes**](https://www.two-pi-noir.agency/puzzles/engagements_and_other_crimes) - As mentioned earlier, we did not presolve this puzzle, but we did bring the original invitation
keepsake, so we didn't have to print it. Which was good, because our access to printing
was pretty low this year, given many students had aged out of teammate and were now just alumni.
We did end up printing more copies, to let more people play around with it.

[**A Map and a Shade (or Four)**](https://www.two-pi-noir.agency/puzzles/a_map_and_a_shade_or_four) - On initial unlock, the person who spent the key said "oh no, this was a scam". I took a look and
said it wasn't obviously a scam,
since it was definitely something with US states and four coloring.
We sat down, started making some derivations, then got distracted by Jargon and I decided I didn't
need to rejoin the group that had picked the puzzle back up. I'd rather work on the fresh puzzle
of Star Crossed.

[**Beyond a Shadow of a Doubt**](https://www.two-pi-noir.agency/puzzles/beyond_a_shadow_of_a_doubt) - This was a pretty neat idea. The main idea comes together pretty elegantly, but the actual grinding
is really non-trivial even if you know what you're doing. Potentially we could have jumped to the final
dropquote and solved around the missing info, but we ended up solving it sequentially and
I proposed the final correct idea for how to use the colors.

[**The Killer**](https://www.two-pi-noir.agency/puzzles/the_killer) - I helped on IDing a few pages
(the ones for Wonderland and Berkeley), but then moved to other puzzles. Only now do I understand
the calls for a Morse code nutrimatic. I'm guessing someone did implement one by Hunt end.

## Endgame

As explained in the wrap-up, in the runaround, teams ended up at the Finster vault. The door was
locked with an audio lock installed by Sidecar. To open the lock, we needed to do [Foley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foley_(filmmaking)) for a 3 minute silent movie. Only one person could
see the movie through a hole in the vault door. The room would first play the movie in the door,
recording all audio, then it would play the movie (with audio) on a big projector.

The audio in wrap-up explaining this was a bit muted, so, for your viewing pleasure, here is our
first attempt.

VIDEO

Yeah, turns out using audio cues during Foley doesn't actually work. A few of us initially planned
to refer to the recording, but D&M came over and quickly gave some in-universe speech about how
it was impossible for us to have such compact video cameras in this day and age, to indicate
using recordings for timing was banned. We did it properly the second time (or more accurately, we
spent so long coordinating that D&M told us "the lock's not *that* sensitive" so that they could
get us out of the vault for the next runaround.)

After this finished, we went back to HQ. I helped clean up, then went with a few others to
the MIT DDR room
