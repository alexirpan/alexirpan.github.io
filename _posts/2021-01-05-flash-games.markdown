As someone "from the Internet", Flash was my childhood.

No, I'm not sure you understand. Flash *was* my childhood. I've easily spent thousands of
hours playing Flash games, and the death of Flash has been a sad thing. The
[Flash Games Postmortem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65crLKNQR0E) at GDC 2017 is still
an amazing talk if you want to understand that era.

There isn't a short version of the talk, but if I had to pick one key point, it would be that
Flash thrived because it ran on almost everything, and it would run the same *way* on almost
everything. It was an interesting era, where everyone knew Flash had problems, but they
understood them, and I don't think the circumstances behind that era can be reproduced.
I believe Flash's success came because it was everywhere and so easily sharable, making a
uniform experience. Now the online experience is fundamentally split between desktop, mobile,
and native apps, all with slightly different character. The monetization strategies are also
different - if you're an independent game developer trying to make a living, you're really
incentivized to go for parasitic free-to-play transactions.

The Flash Games Postmortem talk ended with a Q&A section where someone asked, what's the plan
to preserve the Flash game history, when browser support ends? At the time, it wasn't clear,
but now the frontrunner solution is [BlueMaxima's Flashpoint](https://bluemaxima.org/flashpoint/).
It's an archive of several thousand Flash games and animations, and I had a bunch of fun playing
through parts of the archive I remembered.

A bunch of them have not aged well. Game design has evolved a lot, generally for the better,
and now that I'm playing them as an adult, it's obvious how many of the games I played had filler
content. Nonetheless, I wanted to share some of the highlights that I still found fun.
