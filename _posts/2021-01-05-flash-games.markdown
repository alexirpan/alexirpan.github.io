As someone "from the Internet", Flash was my childhood.

No, I'm not sure you understand. Flash *was* my childhood. I've easily spent thousands of
hours playing Flash games, and it's shaped my thoughts on what games *can* be and what games
*should* be. The death of Flash has been sad in ways that are hard to describe.

If you don't have much time, [Flash Game History](https://www.flashgamehistory.com/)
is an excellent short article that captures the influence of Flash games on game development.
If you have more time, the
[Flash Games Postmortem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65crLKNQR0E) from GDC 2017 is
an long, worthwhile talk that goes into why Flash became popular, with a deeper look at the
logistics of how those games were made and distributed.

There isn't a short version of either of the previous links (and I heavily encourage watching
them yourself),
but if I had to pick one key point, it's this: Flash thrived because it ran the same
way on any platform in the world. Everyone knew Flash had problems, but they understood them,
and out of that we got an incredible free library of creativity and expression.

I'm not sure the Flash era can be reproduced. The Internet was less of a walled garden at the
time, and Flash guaranteed a uniform, easily sharable experience.
Now the online experience is fundamentally split between desktop, mobile,
and native apps, all with slightly different character, and monetization has
homogenized around parasitic free-to-play transactions, rather than advertisements on a Flash
game portal. It's not that F2P is new...it's more that it's eating the world and I don't like
the games it leads to.

With Flash officially unsupported, the best avenue for playing Flash games is
[BlueMaxima's Flashpoint](https://bluemaxima.org/flashpoint/). It's an archive of several
thousand Flash games and animations, and I had a bunch of fun playing through the parts of the
archive I remembered.

A bunch of Flash games have not aged well. Game design has evolved a lot, and as an adult it's
obvious how much filler content many of these games had. Yet they suck me in anyways.
This is why I don't install games on my phone. It's not that I'm too good for them, it's that
I'm too weak. All the tricks to keep people playing work on me, and that's not how I want to
spend my time.

Let's just reminesce about the good stuff. After doing a lot of research (read: playing a
ton of old Flash games), here are some I still like.


Super Mario 63
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![Super Mario 63](/public/flash-games/sm63.png)
{: .centered }

Super Mario 63 is a 2D fangame that mashes up three of the 3D Marios: Super Mario 64,
Super Mario Sunshine, and Super Mario Galaxy. On one hand, it shouldn't be surprising that
the game is fun. It's stealing mechanics and levels from three of the best platformers of
all time. On the other hand, there's still a lot of work required to execute that roadmap
properly, especially in a 2D world.

There's a lot of hidden secrets in the hub area, tied together with a fun movement system. The story
is pretty fanfiction-y, but that isn't the focus of this game. My one complaint is that
Mario is *too* powerful. Many platforming sections are designed to be beatable without the FLUDD,
likely because it's not guaranteed you have it, but the FLUDD comes with so much water that it's
hard to run out unless you try to. That makes most of the platforming sections super easy.
Meanwhile, the spin attack from Galaxy has 0 cooldown, so if you spam the spin attack button
you're practically invincible. Still, in single player games it can be fun to be overpowered,
and the overall package is fun to play with plenty of content.


Sonny + Sonny 2
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![Sonny 2](/public/flash-games/sonny.png)
{: .centered }

Sonny and Sonny 2 are RPGs. You play as Sonny, a person who turned into a zombie, has
amnesia, and doesn't remember anything before being a zombie. You travel with two goals: figure out how you got
turned into a zombie, and survive.

Part of Sonny's strength is its high production value. The game has a distinctive art style, voice acting,
music, and well-done sound effects. However, I love this game because it really rewards digging into
the combat system.
A lot of RPGs have skill trees that are basically
variants of "do more damage" or "attack with this element". Most of the skills are strictly better than
other ones, and the progression is about grinding EXP to learn the more powerful ones.
Sonny doesn't do this. Instead, all your skills slightly different. Some will stun the enemy, some will
apply debuffs, some dispel enemy buffs, some grant stats at the cost of other stats, and so on.
The game UI (usually) spells out exactly what enemy buffs and debuffs do, making it clear what the current
battle state is, and giving you all the information needed to figure out how to counter it.

It gives the game a puzzle feel, where gameplay is more about finding good skill
combos and synergies, rather than brute-force leveling. In fact, Sonny 2 has a series of bonus bosses that you can only
unlock if you beat the game on the hardest difficulty, at the lowest possible level (skip all optional
fights), and this is entirely possible once you figure out the right tools for each fight.

I will say that once you figure out the best skill combos, it becomes hard to play the game casually,
especially when the bonus bosses practically require using the broken combinations. The praise is also mostly
for Sonny 2. Sonny 1 has some of the same flavor, but its skill tree has less depth to it.
My main criticism is that at times the skills are *too* complicated. Practically every attack in the game has a
side effect, and a bunch of my early playtime was spent just reading all the skill descriptions to figure out what
build I wanted to make. I find that fun, but I know not everyone does. I think the complexity could have been
toned down without compromising on depth. On the other hand, the complexity is why I like it...so perhaps
it's fine as is.


Mastermind: World Conqueror
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![Mastermind](/public/flash-games/mastermind.png)
{: .centered }

It's been over 10 years since I played this game, and I still feel the same way about it, in a good way.
Mastermind: World Conqueror is a real-time strategy game, where you play a villain trying to take over the world.
Recruit minions, send them on missions to earn money, advance through the tech tree, upgrade your base,
and fight off the good guys that try to stop you.

A lot of the features are sort of useless. For example, in my many plays through the game, I've never found a use for the
henchmen. They're too expensive compared to just buying more guys after they die in combat.
I also don't like that you can only plan and execute 1 mission at a time. It really limits the multitasking
ceiling, and once you're in the late game you're mostly waiting for progress bars to finish.
Besides that, I don't have complaints about the game. The core gameplay loop
of steal cash -> use cash to buy upgrades and plan other missions -> repeat
works for me, and the theming is on point. It's just plain *fun* to play the villain.


Epic Battle Fantasy 3 + 4 + 5
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![Epic Battle Fantasy 5](/public/flash-games/ebf.png)
{: .centered }

Okay. Okay okay okay. First things first: the series has really juvenille humor. Basically the series was
started by a horny teenage boy who liked anime, and the humor never evolved past that.

If you can ignore that issue, then you'll find a quality JRPG. Epic Battle Fantasy 1 and 2 are pure boss
rushes, and they're fun enough, but from the 3rd entry on you get an overworld, block pushing puzzles, treasure chests, an equipment
upgrade system, the whole works.

Epic Battle Fantasy isn't trying to do anything crazy to the JRPG genre, but I think that's
fine. The one thing it does different is its equipment system. Instead of giving flat stats, all weapons and
armors grant percentage based stats. So for example, a weapon could give +30% attack and +15% defense, or +50%
attack and -20% defense. Similar to Sonny, old weapons are never strictly worse, because percentages naturally
scale with your stats as you level up. Your equipment choice is therefore more about what passives you want, what playstyle
you prefer, and what elemental weaknesses your foes have, rather than pure stats. I appreciate this - it's nice
to not have a ton of old items clogging up my inventory.


Amorphous+
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![Amorphous](/public/flash-games/amorphous2.png)
{: .centered }

This game has one button: attack. That's it. Despite that, it's a surprisingly deep arcade game.
Your goal is to kill Glooples with your giant sword. You attack in a wide arc in front of you, but every
attack comes with a long recovery time where you can't move and are vulnerable to attack.
Different Glooples have different attack patterns, Glooples can interact with each other, and you get
one life to clear all the enemies. If you die, you start over.

It's an action game with minimal upgrades. You unlock rewards based on your achievements, but can only equip at
most 2, so you reach max power pretty early and the rest of the game is solely about learning attack patterns
and getting better at dodging.
And if you want to get better, there's a practice mode where you can spawn all the hard enemies you
want.

I recommend treating this game as a roguelike, because, well, it basically is one, and part of the roguelike
experience is learning the mechanics on your own. Then, once you've seen most of the monsters, you can look
up a guide if you're struggling on something.
If you're aim is 100% completion, a guide is practically mandatory.
Many of the achievements require engineering pretty weird scenarios that don't come up in normal play.

If you do go for 100%, I recommend using the glitch that lets you earn achievements in Practice Mode. I didn't do this when I
first played the game, out of a sense of honor, but this was a mistake. All my honor led to was spending
many, many hours waiting for the right rare Gloople to spawn, just so I could get the "kill X copies of
(super rare enemy)" achievements. There's no honor in waitng for the right RNG roll.


Motherload
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![Motherload](/public/flash-games/motherload.png)
{: .centered }

I almost didn't include this one...but it's iconic, and I found it weirdly captivating on a replay,
so I'll give it a shout out.

The mechanics are very simple.
Drill down to pick up ore. Fly back to the surface
when you run out of gas to refuel. Sell your ore to pay for refueling, and to buy upgrades that let
you dig deeper for more valuable ores. Rinse and repeat.
Not a lot of depth, but there's a Zen feeling in figuring out the shortest path to each ore.
The key that makes the entire game work is that you can't drill upwards. Because of this, you
can make ore inaccessible if you drill poorly, and that's just enough thinking to stop it from
being totally mindless. It's a bit like Bejeweled in that sense, although Bejeweled didn't have
an upgrade system or resource management.

My main issue with the game is that dying has an insane penalty. If you die, all drilled holes
are reset. So if you die in the late game,
get ready to hold down for several minutes to get back to where you were before. This wouldn't
be so bad if gas pockets weren't a thing. After a certain depth, dirt blocks have a random
chance of having explosive gas pockts.
You're warned about them once, but the game doesn't emphasize how
destructive they are. Gas pockets are 100% undetectable, can't be avoided, and do massive amounts of damage,
to the point that they're a
one-hit kill if you don't have enough HP and defense upgrades.
So basically, gas pockets are an
invisible stat check, you have no way of knowing what stats you need ahead of time, and if you fail the
stat check then you have to redrill all the way back down.

Once you know how to deal with gas pockets, the game doesn't have many surprises. The late game
ores are so lucrative that it's pretty easy to reach the end in a practically invicible state.


Elements of Arkandia
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![Elements of Arkandia](/public/flash-games/arkandia.png)
{: .centered }

This game should not work. The mechanics are poorly explained. Stats have
incorrect descriptions. Art assets get reused across equipment - you'll have multiple shields
that look exactly the same, with wildly different stats, which is a problem when deciding what
to sell. There are massive difficulty spikes.
And most importantly, who uses Impact font this much? I'm not even kidding, the font usage
in this game is awful and it makes a ton of things harder to read than they should.

Despite all of those issues, I like this game. It's a mashup of mechanics from
two games: Puzzle Quest, and Recettear: An Item Shop's Tale. And, well, it's not as good
as either individual game, but there's a kernel of fun that carries all the weird presentation.

You start the game with a large debt, that accumulates interest every day. To pay off the
debt, you need to go on dungeon adventures to find loot.
Battles are done through a Bejeweled board. Matching gems of the same color gives mana,
gold, treasure, or rage, and forming a group of 4 or 5 gives an extra turn.
Mana can be used to cast spells that affect the board or do damage. For example,
there's a spell that changes all gold gems to treasure gems, making it easier to form groups
of 4 to get more extra turns. Rage can be spent to attack with your weapon, which is usually
your main damage source.

Once you find loot, you need to stock it in your shop. It's Recettear, but without the
haggling - you have no control over what price items sell for, but you can pick crests that
increase the odds of selling certain items, and depending on market conditions some items
will be more popular than other ones.

Everything in Elements of Arkandia revolves around money. You need to balance
paying off your debt, upgrading your store, and buying battle upgrades that enable clearing
harder dungeons. Then battles themselves are about figuring out what types of mana are
easy or hard to achieve, and using that to decide what kind of spells you're going to aim for.

Two bits
of advice. One: you can choose to play without debt, but you should play with debt. If you
play without debt, you remove all the interesting trade-offs on how to spend your money,
making the gameplay really boring. Two: if you want, you can try to min-max every move,
since there are no turn timers. I don't think you should do this. Battles are long enough
that trying to min-max every board will just drive you insane. Just aim for an acceptable
move and keep going.


Portal: The Flash Version
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![Portal flash version](/public/flash-games/portal.png)
{: .centered }

There's an interesting story behind this game.
The creators of the game watched the trailers for Portal 1, and were SUPER PSYCHED. They were
so excited that they implemented Portal's mechanics in Flash, creating puzzles based on all
pre-release content they could find.
After fleshing it out more, they got good feedback from friends and
family, so they released it publicly 1 day before the official game came out.

The end result is missing Portal's sharp writing, but the puzzles are uncannily accurate. The
mechanics they added themselves also work quite well.
The main problem the game has is that sometimes you know exactly what you need to do, but
then you mistime the portal shot and have to start all over. The timings are tighter than
Portal proper, so adjust your expectations going in. Objects will sometimes get bumped through
walls as well, but I never experienced a game breaking bug.


SHIFT
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![Shift 4](/public/flash-games/shift.png)
{: .centered }

There are four games in the series, and they all try to ride the wave of Portal's popularity:
a puzzle game with jokey, vaguely antagonistic writing from whoever's making you solve these
puzzles. SHIFT does so with some fourth-wall breaking commentary, surrounding the core puzzles.

In retrospect, the puzzle gameplay isn't that interesting.
A lot of the levels have a problem where there's one clear
move at the start, then after you do that there's another clear move, and another one after that,
and then you reach the exit just by going through the motions. But this is kind of a universal
puzzle game problem - very few successfully avoid this trap, and the ones that do usually
end up being bigger experiences than what you'd expect from a Flash game. I don't have a problem
with it. Later games in the SHIFT series get better about this, by including more branching
paths that make trial-and-error more time consuming.


Cursor\*10
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![Cursor\*10](/public/flash-games/cursor.png)
{: .centered }

A game about collaborating with yourself. Best played blind! It's short, you'll see how it
works.


Ghost Hacker
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![Ghost Hacker](/public/flash-games/ghosthacker.png)
{: .centered }

Ghost Hacker is a tower defense game, and I'll be honest, it shouldn't be listed over
classics like Bloons Tower Defense or Kingdom Rush. But I like how it's designed, and fewer
people have heard of it.

In Ghost Hacker, your main resource is memory. Placing a tower costs memory, killing enemies
gives memory, kill enemies to afford more towers and tower upgrades to kill stronger enemies, etc.
The way Ghost Hacker differs is that towers are upgraded through *modifiers*. For example, in a standard
tower defense game, you might have one tower that slows down enemies. In Ghost Hacker, there's
a slow-enemy modifier, which can be applied to *any* tower. Then it's up to the player to (for
example) realize that you get more utlity from your slow-enemy modifier if you attach it to a
tower that does splash damage, since it makes the slow apply to everything in splash range.

The other key part of Ghost Hacker's design is that you can never, ever lose memory. Often,
tower defense games will only refund part of the cost if you sell a tower. This can feel really
punishing - misplace a tower early, and you either have to settle for the suboptimal placement, or
sell and rebuild your tower, losing out on the sell cost.
In Ghost Hacker, selling a tower always gives back the full price...eventually. Any time you earn memory, instead of receiving it instantly, you get some of it
every tick. In principle, that means you can completely change up your towers between waves, as long
as you have time to get back your memory and re-spend it. Pretty simple mechanic, but it goes a long
way to making the game feel less punishing if you make a bad decision.


Fancy Pants Adventure
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![Fancy Pants](/public/flash-games/fancypants.png)
{: .centered }

Another platforming game. You can slide, you can wall jump, the levels are really open-ended and
filled with collectibles, and at the same time you can beat the game very quickly if you don't care
about any of that. The entire series is worth playing, but I'd say it really hits its stride starting
from World 2. And the animation for everything is super smooth.


Level Up!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![Level Up!](/public/flash-games/levelup.png)
{: .centered }

(You want the one by Nifty Hat. Level UP! is a different game.)

It's a little hard to categorize this game, but the closest approximation is "platformer collect-a-thon".
As the name suggests, the game is about leveling up, and it does so with a pretty unique system - the
more you do something, the better you get at it. If you jump a lot, you learn to jump higher. Run
more and you learn to run faster. Get hit a lot, and you learn to take less damage. Stand in place
for a while, and you learn new ways to waste time (unlock new idle animations). It all feels
very realistic to real-life learning.

Exploring the game world gives you gems, which you can use to buy new skills, making it easier to
reach other gems, and the final goal is to hit the max level for every skill. You only get so much
time to explore each day, so the game eventually takes on a time-loop feel where you're trying to get
faster at going everywhere you need to go each cycle.

The sequel teased in the game's 100% ending was never completed, so don't go looking for it.

"Meta" Games
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![Achivement Unlocked](/public/flash-games/achievement.png)
{: .centered }

![You Only Live Once](/public/flash-games/yolo.png)
{: .centered }

A scattering of games that play with game mechanics and tickle my self-referential soft spots.

In no particular order: **Upgrade Complete** (upgrade all the things!), **Achievement Unlocked** (unlock all the achievements!), **This is the Only Level** (finish the same level over and over!), and **You Only Live Once** (you only live once!). Parts of Achievement Unlocked 2 may not work well with the Flashpoint
archive. It would be a spoiler to say what part, but I didn't figure out a workaround for it.


jmtb02 Games
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![Exit Path](/public/flash-games/exitpath.png)
{: .centered }

![Elephant Rave](/public/flash-games/rave.png)
{: .centered }

jmtb02 is the dev handle of John Cooney, a prolific Flash game developer who made a lot of games
I liked. In retrospect, the reason I like his games is that they usually avoid filler or grinding.
It felt like he understood the niche of Flash gaming and made many well-polished short experiences
that didn't try to overstay their welcome.

**Achievement Unlocked** and **This is the Only Level** were both by him, and in no particular
order I would also recommend **Hedgehog Launch**, **Elephant Quest**, **Sixty**, **Exit Path**,
**Soviet Rocket Giraffe**, **Epic Combo**, and **Elephant Rave HD**.


Don't Look Back
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![Don't Look Back](/public/flash-games/dontlookback.png)
{: .centered }

A game by Terry Cavanagh, who later became well known for VVVVVV, Super Hexagon, and Dicey
Dungeons. I thought all three of those games were fun, although Dicey Dungeons isn't as good
as other deckbuilder roguelikes.

Don't Look Back is one of those games that tries to express a narrative through gameplay. The
controls aren't that tight, but the moment where you realize what story the game is telling
is pretty cool.


Fisher Diver
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![Fisher Diver](/public/flash-games/fisherdiver.png)
{: .centered }

Fisher Diver is a game by 2DArray, and they're most known for The Company of Myself. I find it hard
to recommend Compay of Myself these days - it has one very cool moment, but the rest of the narration
doesn't land for me the same way it did before. However, Fisher Diver does land the same way
on a replay.

It's a game about fishing, but I see it more as commentary about the morality of fishing. You earn
money by catching fish. Every time you attack a fish, it costs oxygen and breaks the fish apart.
You earn more money if the fish is more intact. The natural conclusion? You should attack just
enough to deal a lethal wound, then wait next to the fish and watch it bleed to death.
It's a cold-hearted callousness that's both more realistic and *really different* from how a fishing game
normally works. The description of a shop upgrade puts it best: "it wouldn't be hunting if they
stood a chance".


Winnie the Pooh's Home Run Derby
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![Winnie the Pooh](/public/flash-games/pooh.png)
{: .centered }

Okay, I'll be honest, I haven't played much of this game. I played enough to confirm the memes
about its difficulty, then decided I didn't want to finish it. This game is horseshit in a way
that doesn't feel fair. I can't recommend anyone play it for fun, but the memes are
excellent.
