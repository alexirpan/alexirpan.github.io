title:  "Reliving Flash Game History"

As someone "from the Internet", Flash was my childhood.

No, I'm not sure you understand. Flash *was* my childhood. I've easily spent thousands of
hours playing Flash games, and the death of Flash has been a sad thing. The
[Flash Games Postmortem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65crLKNQR0E) at GDC 2017 is still
an amazing talk if you want to understand that era.

There isn't a short version of the talk, but if I had to pick one key point, it would be that
Flash thrived because it ran on almost everything, and it would run the same *way* on almost
everything. It was an interesting era, where everyone knew Flash had problems, but they
understood them, and I don't think the circumstances behind that era can be reproduced.
I believe Flash's success came because it was everywhere and so easily sharable, making a
uniform experience. Now the online experience is fundamentally split between desktop, mobile,
and native apps, all with slightly different character. The monetization strategies are also
different - if you're an independent game developer trying to make a living, you're really
incentivized to go for parasitic free-to-play transactions.

The Flash Games Postmortem talk ended with a Q&A section where someone asked, what's the plan
to preserve the Flash game history, when browser support ends? At the time, it wasn't clear,
but now the frontrunner solution is [BlueMaxima's Flashpoint](https://bluemaxima.org/flashpoint/).
It's an archive of several thousand Flash games and animations, and I had a bunch of fun playing
through parts of the archive I remembered.

A bunch of them have not aged well. Game design has evolved a lot, generally for the better,
and now that I'm playing them as an adult, it's obvious how many of the games I played had filler
content. Nonetheless, I wanted to share some of the ones that held up for me.


Super Mario 63
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Super Mario 63 is a 2D fangame, that mashes up three of the 3D Marios: Super Mario 64,
Super Mario Sunshine, and Super Mario Galaxy. On one hand, it shouldn't be surprising that
the game is so good. It's stealing mechanics and levels from three of the best platformers of
all time. On the other hand, there's still a lot of work required to execute that roadmap
properly, especially in a 2D world.

There's a lot of hidden secrets in the hub area, and the movement system is great. The story
is pretty fanfiction-y, but that isn't the focus of this game. My one complaint is that
Mario is *too* powerful. Many platforming sections are designed to be beatable without the FLUDD,
likely because it's not guaranteed you have FLUDD. But, the FLUDD comes with so much water that
you probably still have it, making many of the platforming sections a joke. Meanwhile, there's
0 cooldown on the spin attack, so if you spam the spin attack button you'll be practically
invincible. Still, in single player games, it can be fun to be overpowered.


Sonny
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sonny and Sonny 2 are two RPG games. You play as Sonny, an amnesiac zombie that maintains mental capacity
and doesn't want to eat people. Your travel the world with two goals: figure out how you got
turned into a zombie, and survive. It's a turn-based game with a level-up system, skill tree, and
equipment.

Part of Sonny's strength is its high production value. The game has a distinctive art style, voice acting,
music, and well-done sound effects. However, I love this game because of the creativity and flexibility of its combat
system. Sonny has access to a ton of tools. A lot of RPGs have skill trees that are basically
variants of "do more damage" or "attack with this element". Most of the skills are clearly better than
other ones, and the progression is about grinding EXP to learn the more powerful ones.
Sonny avoids this problem by making all your skills slightly different. Some will stun the enemy, some will
apply debuffs, some dispel enemy buffs, and so on. The game UI (usually) spells out exactly
what enemy buffs and debuffs do, making it clear what your opponents are able to do and giving you all the
information needed to figure out how to counter it.
It gives the game a puzzle feel, where gameplay is more about finding good skill
combos and synergies, rather than brute-force leveling. In fact, in Sonny 2, one of the bonus areas is only unlocked
if you do a low% run on the hardest difficulty. The game is designed to make this doable.

I will say that once you know the best skill combos, it can be hard to play the game casually, especially
when the bonus bosses practically require using the broken combinations. That reduces the replay value.
Additionally, the praise is mostly for Sonny 2. Sonny 1 has a bit of the same flavor, but a lot of skills
in Sonny 1 just aren't worth the time, and are closer to a typical RPG. This also isn't the game for you
if you don't like reading. The skills are complex and you have to read their full description to figure out
how they might work together.


Epic Battle Fantasy
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Okay. Okay okay okay. First things first: the series has really juvenille humor. It's like the game was
written by a horny teenage boy, and then it never evolved past that.

If you can ignore that, then you'll find a quality JRPG. Epic Battle Fantasy 1 and 2 are perfectly
playable, but they're basically boss rushes. Starting from the 3rd entry, you get a real JRPG. There's an
overworld, small puzzles, treasure chests, crafting, a level up system, bosses, the whole works. I wouldn't pay
for it, but it's pretty high quality for a free RPG.

Epic Battle Fantasy isn't trying to rock the boat, or do anything crazy to the JRPG genre, but I think that's
fine. The one thing it does different is its equipment system. Instead of giving flat stats, all weapons and
armors grant percentage based stats. So for example, a weapon could give +30% attack and +15% defense, or +50%
attack and -20% defense. Similar to Sonny, old weapons are never strictly worse, because they all scale with
your stats as you level up. Your equipment choice is therefore more about what passives you want, what playstyle
you prefer, and what elemental weaknesses your foes have.

This is another game where you need to be willing to read, although not to the same extent as Sonny 2. The reading
in this game is more about scanning for elemental weaknesses than complicated skills.


Mastermind: World Conqueror
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It's been over 10 years since I played this game, and I still feel the same way about it, in a good way.
Mastermind: World Conqueror is a real-time strategy game, where you play a villain trying to take over the world.
Recruit minions, send them on missions to earn money, advance through the tech tree, upgrade your base,
and fight off the good guys that try to stop you.

A lot of the features are sort of useless, or aren't cost effective. For example, in my many plays through the game, I've never found a use for the
henchmen. I also don't like that you can only plan and execute 1 mission at a time. It really limits the potential
multitasking, and once you're in the late game you're mostly just waiting for loading bars to finish and watching your minions
mow down enemy forces.
Despite this, something about the core gameplay loop
of steal cash -> use cash to buy upgrades and plan other missions -> repeat works for me. The game is on the easy side,
but I don't think that's a bad thing.



Amorphous+
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This game has one button: attack. That's pretty much it. Despite that, it's a surprisingly deep arcade game.
Your goal is to kill Glooples with your giant sword. It attacks in a wide arc in front of you. The range
is traded off with recovery time where you aren't able to move.
Different Glooples have different attack patterns and interactions with other Glooples, and although many aren't
lethal, you only get one life.

It's an action game with minimal upgrades. You unlock rewards based on your achievements, but can only equip at
most 2, so you reach max power without much playtime and the rest of the game is solely about your skill.
And if you want to get better, there's a practice mode where you can spawn all the hard enemies you
want, until you learn their patterns well enough to handle them for real.

I recommend treating this game as a roguelike, because, well, it basically is one, and part of the roguelike
experience is learning the mechanics on your own. Then once you've seen most of the monsters, look up a guide
if you want to go for 100% completion.
Many of the achievements require engineering pretty weird scenarios that don't come up in normal play.
I also recommend using the glitch that lets you earn achievements in Practice Mode, unless you want to play
several hours waiting for the right rare Gloople to spawn. My first time through, I didn't use the glitch
becaause I wanted to be honorable, but that was a mistake. There's no skill in playing runs until you
get the right rare enemy to spawn.


Motherload
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I struggled to get far in Motherload without cheats, because I never wanted to make an
XGenStudios account to save my progress, and the game is surprisingly long. I eventually caved
in and made one with a really obvious username and password, so obvious that other users
successfully guessed it and took over my save file.

There isn't a lot to say about the mechanics. Drill down to pick up ore. Fly back to the surface
when you run out of gas to refuel, sell your ore, and buy upgrades, which helps you go deeper
and mine more material. Rinse and repeat until you get to the end. Not a lot of depth, but
there's a Zen feeling in figuring out the shortest path to each ore. It's important that you
can't drill upwards, since if you drill poorly, you can easily make it much harder to mine
the ore you want. It's just enough thinking to stop it from being totally mindless. Kinda
like Bejeweled, except with an upgrade system and resource management.

My main issue with the game is that dying has an insane penalty. If you die, you go back to
your last save point, but all drilled holes will be reset. So if you die in the late game,
get ready to hold down for several minutes to get back to where you were before. This wouldn't
be so bad if gas pockets weren't a thing. After a certain depth, dirt blocks will randomly
have gas pockets. You're warned about them once, but the game doesn't emphasize how
destructive they can be. Gas pockets are 100% undetectable, can't be avoided, do massive amounts of damage,
and are a one-hit kill if you don't have enough HP and defense upgrades. Meanwhile, the game
heavily incentivizes digging deeper. Rare ores appear more often at high depths and each tier
trades in for much more than the previous one. So basically, gas pockets are just an
invisible stat check and players don't know they exist until they hit it.

Once you know how to deal with gas pockets, the game doesn't have many surprises, and it's
pretty easy to reach the end in a practically invincible state.


Elements of Arkandia
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This game really shouldn't work. The mechanics are really poorly explained. Stats have
incorrect descriptions. Art assets get reused across equipment - you'll have multiple shields
that look exactly the same, with wildly different stats. There are massive difficulty spikes.
And most importantly, who uses Impact font this much? I'm not even kidding, the font usage
in this game is really bad and it makes a ton of things harder to read than they should.

Despite all of those issues, I like this game. It's a mashup of mechanics from
two games: Puzzle Quest, and Recettear: An Item Shop's Tale.

You start the game with a large debt, that accumulates interest every day. To pay off the
debt, you need to go on dungeon adventures, find loot, then sell that loot in your shop.

Battles are done through a Bejeweled board. You try to match 3 gems of the same color together.
Forming a group of 4 or 5 gives an extra turn. Gems either grant mana, give gold, give
treasure, or give rage. Mana can be used to cast spells that affect the board. For example,
there's a spell that changes all gold gems to treasure gems, making it easier to line up groups
of 4 to get more extra turns. Rage can be spent to attack with your weapon, which is usually
your main damage source.

The shop stocking is Recetter without the haggling. You stock loot in your store, pick crests
that increase the odds of selling certain items, then open your store and see what sales you
can make. Everything in Elements of Arkandia revolves around money. You need to balance
paying off your debt, upgrading your store, and buying battle upgrades that enable clearing
harder dungeons. Then battles themselves are about figuring out what types of mana are
easy or hard to achieve, and using that to decide what kind of spells you're going to aim for.

It's not as good as Puzzle Quest, and it's not as good as Recettear, but it's still fun,
albeit with a really grindy endgame. Two bits
of advice. One: you can choose to play without debt, but you should play with debt. If you
play without debt, you remove all the interesting trade-offs on how to spend your money,
making the gameplay really boring. Two: if you want, you can try to min-max every move,
since there are no turn timers. I don't think you should do this. Battles are long enough
that trying to min-max every board will just drive you insane. Just aim for an acceptable
move and keep going.


Portal: The Flash Version
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There's an interesting story behind this game.

The creators of the game watched the trailers for Portal 1, and were SUPER PSYCHED. They were
so excited that they implemented Portal's mechanics in Flash, creating puzzles based on what
they saw from the trailer. After fleshing it out more, they got good feedback from friends and
family, so they released it publicly, 1 day before the official game came out.

The end result is missing Portal's sharp writing, but the puzzles are uncannily accurate. The
mechanics they added themselves also work quite well, and the overall package is pretty good.
The main problem the game has is that sometimes, you know exactly what you need to do, and
executing the portal shots in the required time window is the hard part. These execution
tests are tighter than any from Portal proper, so you need to adjust your expectations going
in. The QA is also worse, sometimes objects get bumped through walls they shouldn't, but I never
experienced a game breaking bug.


Shift series
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Shift series is based around one concept.

GIF

There are a few games in the series. The first one is a good showcase of the idea, but in retrospect,
the puzzle gameplay isn't very good. A lot of the levels have a problem where there's one clear
move at the start, then after you do that there's another clear move, and another one after that,
and then you hit the exit door without ever thinking about how to get there. Later games in
the series get better about this.



Ghost Hacker
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ghost Hacker is a tower defense game, and I'll be honest, it probably shouldn't be listed over
some of the other famous ones, like Bloons Tower Defense or Kingdom Rush.
