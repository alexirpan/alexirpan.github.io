As someone "from the Internet", Flash was my childhood.

No, I'm not sure you understand. Flash *was* my childhood. I've easily spent thousands of
hours playing Flash games, and the death of Flash has been a sad thing. The
[Flash Games Postmortem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65crLKNQR0E) at GDC 2017 is still
an amazing talk if you want to understand that era.

There isn't a short version of the talk, but if I had to pick one key point, it would be that
Flash thrived because it ran on almost everything, and it would run the same *way* on almost
everything. It was an interesting era, where everyone knew Flash had problems, but they
understood them, and I don't think the circumstances behind that era can be reproduced.
I believe Flash's success came because it was everywhere and so easily sharable, making a
uniform experience. Now the online experience is fundamentally split between desktop, mobile,
and native apps, all with slightly different character. The monetization strategies are also
different - if you're an independent game developer trying to make a living, you're really
incentivized to go for parasitic free-to-play transactions.

The Flash Games Postmortem talk ended with a Q&A section where someone asked, what's the plan
to preserve the Flash game history, when browser support ends? At the time, it wasn't clear,
but now the frontrunner solution is [BlueMaxima's Flashpoint](https://bluemaxima.org/flashpoint/).
It's an archive of several thousand Flash games and animations, and I had a bunch of fun playing
through parts of the archive I remembered.

A bunch of them have not aged well. Game design has evolved a lot, generally for the better,
and now that I'm playing them as an adult, it's obvious how many of the games I played had filler
content. Nonetheless, I wanted to share some of the highlights. Fair warning: I have a lot of
nostalgia for these games, but I'm also going to ruthless about parts I don't like.


Motherload
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I struggled to get far in Motherload without cheats, because I never wanted to make an
XGenStudios account to save my progress, and the game is surprisingly long. I eventually caved
in and made one with a really obvious username and password, so obvious that other users
successfully guessed it and took over my save file.

There isn't a lot to say about the mechanics. Drill down to pick up ore. Fly back to the surface
when you run out of gas to refuel, sell your ore, and buy upgrades, which helps you go deeper
and mine more material. Rinse and repeat until you get to the end. Not a lot of depth, but
there's a Zen feeling in figuring out the shortest path to each ore. It's important that you
can't drill upwards, since if you drill poorly, you can easily make it much harder to mine
the ore you want. It's just enough thinking to stop it from being totally mindless.

My main issue with the game is that dying has an insane penalty. If you die, you go back to
your last save point, but all drilled holes will be reset. So if you die in the late game,
get ready to hold down for several minutes to get back to where you were before. This wouldn't
be so bad if gas pockets weren't a thing. After a certain depth, dirt blocks will randomly
have gas pockets. You're warned about them once, but the game doesn't emphasize how
destructive they can be. Gas pockets are 100% undetectable, can't be avoided, do massive amounts of damage,
and are a one-hit kill if you don't have enough HP and defense upgrades. Meanwhile, the game
heavily incentivizes digging deeper. Rare ores appear more often at high depths and each tier
trades in for much more than the previous one. So basically, gas pockets are just an
invisible stat check and players don't know they exist until they hit it.

Once you know how to deal with gas pockets, the game doesn't have many surprises, and it's
pretty easy to reach the end in a practically invincible state.


Shift series
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Shift series is based around one concept.

There are a few games in the series. The first one is a good showcase of the idea, but in retrospect,
the puzzle gameplay isn't very good. A lot of the levels have a problem where there's one clear
move at the start, then after you do that there's another clear move, and another one after that,
and then you hit the exit door without ever thinking about how to get there. Later games in
the series get better about this.
