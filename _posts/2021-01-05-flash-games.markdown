As someone "from the Internet", Flash was my childhood.

No, I'm not sure you understand. Flash *was* my childhood. I've easily spent thousands of
hours playing Flash games, and the death of Flash has been a sad thing. The
[Flash Games Postmortem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65crLKNQR0E) at GDC 2017 is still
an amazing talk if you want to understand that era.

There isn't a short version of the talk, but if I had to pick one key point, it would be that
Flash thrived because it ran on almost everything, and it would run the same *way* on almost
everything. It was an interesting era, where everyone knew Flash had problems, but they
understood them, and I don't think the circumstances behind that era can be reproduced.
I believe Flash's success came because it was everywhere and so easily sharable, making a
uniform experience. Now the online experience is fundamentally split between desktop, mobile,
and native apps, all with slightly different character. The monetization strategies are also
different - if you're an independent game developer trying to make a living, you're really
incentivized to go for parasitic free-to-play transactions.

The Flash Games Postmortem talk ended with a Q&A section where someone asked, what's the plan
to preserve the Flash game history, when browser support ends? At the time, it wasn't clear,
but now the frontrunner solution is [BlueMaxima's Flashpoint](https://bluemaxima.org/flashpoint/).
It's an archive of several thousand Flash games and animations, and I had a bunch of fun playing
through parts of the archive I remembered.

A bunch of them have not aged well. Game design has evolved a lot, generally for the better,
and now that I'm playing them as an adult, it's obvious how many of the games I played had filler
content. Nonetheless, I wanted to share some of the ones that held up for me.


Super Mario 63
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Super Mario 63 is a 2D fangame, that mashes up three of the 3D Marios: Super Mario 64,
Super Mario Sunshine, and Super Mario Galaxy. On one hand, it shouldn't be surprising that
the game is so good. It's stealing mechanics and levels from three of the best platformers of
all time. On the other hand, there's still a lot of work required to execute that roadmap
properly, especially in a 2D world.

There's a lot of hidden secrets in the hub area, and the movement system is great. The story
is pretty fanfiction-y, but that isn't the focus of this game. My one complaint is that
Mario is *too* powerful. Many platforming sections are designed to be beatable without the FLUDD,
likely because it's not guaranteed you have FLUDD. But, the FLUDD comes with so much water that
you probably still have it, making many of the platforming sections a joke. Meanwhile, there's
0 cooldown on the spin attack, so if you spam the spin attack button you'll be practically
invincible. Still, in single player games, it can be fun to be overpowered.


Sonny
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sonny and Sonny 2 are two RPG games. You play as Sonny, an amnesiac zombie that maintains mental capacity
and doesn't want to eat people. Your travel the world with two goals: figure out how you got
turned into a zombie, and survive. It's a turn-based game with a level-up system, skill tree, and
equipment.

Part of Sonny's strength is its high production value. The game has a distinctive art style, voice acting,
music, and well-done sound effects. However, I love this game because of the creativity and flexibility of its combat
system. Sonny has access to a ton of tools. A lot of RPGs have skill trees that are basically
variants of "do more damage" or "attack with this element". Most of the skills are clearly better than
other ones, and the progression is about grinding EXP to learn the more powerful ones.
Sonny avoids this problem by making all your skills slightly different. Some will stun the enemy, some will
apply debuffs, some dispel enemy buffs, and so on. The game UI (usually) spells out exactly
what enemy buffs and debuffs do, making it clear what your opponents are able to do and giving you all the
information needed to figure out how to counter it.
It gives the game a puzzle feel, where gameplay is more about finding good skill
combos and synergies, rather than brute-force leveling. In fact, in Sonny 2, one of the bonus areas is only unlocked
if you do a low% run on the hardest difficulty. The game is designed to make this doable.

I will say that once you know the best skill combos, it can be hard to play the game casually, especially
when the bonus bosses practically require using the broken combinations. That reduces the replay value.
Additionally, the praise is mostly for Sonny 2. Sonny 1 has a bit of the same flavor, but a lot of skills
in Sonny 1 just aren't worth the time, and are closer to a typical RPG. This also isn't the game for you
if you don't like reading. The skills are complex and you have to read their full description to figure out
how they might work together.


Epic Battle Fantasy
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Okay. Okay okay okay. First things first: the series has really juvenille humor. It's like the game was
written by a horny teenage boy, and then it never evolved past that.

If you can ignore that, then you'll find a quality JRPG. Epic Battle Fantasy 1 and 2 are perfectly
playable, but they're basically boss rushes. Starting from the 3rd entry, you get a real JRPG. There's an
overworld, small puzzles, treasure chests, crafting, a level up system, bosses, the whole works. I wouldn't pay
for it, but it's pretty high quality for a free RPG.

Epic Battle Fantasy isn't trying to rock the boat, or do anything crazy to the JRPG genre, but I think that's
fine. The one thing it does different is its equipment system. Instead of giving flat stats, all weapons and
armors grant percentage based stats. So for example, a weapon could give +30% attack and +15% defense, or +50%
attack and -20% defense. Similar to Sonny, old weapons are never strictly worse, because they all scale with
your stats as you level up. Your equipment choice is therefore more about what passives you want, what playstyle
you prefer, and what elemental weaknesses your foes have.

This is another game where you need to be willing to read, although not to the same extent as Sonny 2. The reading
in this game is more about scanning for elemental weaknesses than complicated skills.


Amorphous+
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This game has one button: attack. That's pretty much it. Despite that, it's a surprisingly deep arcade game.
Your goal is to kill Glooples with your giant sword. It attacks in a wide arc in front of you. The range
is traded off with recovery time where you aren't able to move.
Different Glooples have different attack patterns and interactions with other Glooples, and although many aren't
lethal, you only get one life.

It's an action game with minimal upgrades. You unlock rewards based on your achievements, but can only equip at
most 2, so you get to a good setup pretty quickly and the rest of the game is solely about your skill at playing
the game. And if you want to get better, there's a practice mode where you can spawn all the hard enemies you
want, until you learn their patterns well enough to handle them for real.

After playing for a bit on your own, I highly recommend using a guide to look up what achivements there are. Many
of the achievements are hard to discover on your own. I wouldn't use a guide right away though, because this
game is basically a roguelike, and part of the roguelike experience is learning the mechanics on your own.


Motherload
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I struggled to get far in Motherload without cheats, because I never wanted to make an
XGenStudios account to save my progress, and the game is surprisingly long. I eventually caved
in and made one with a really obvious username and password, so obvious that other users
successfully guessed it and took over my save file.

There isn't a lot to say about the mechanics. Drill down to pick up ore. Fly back to the surface
when you run out of gas to refuel, sell your ore, and buy upgrades, which helps you go deeper
and mine more material. Rinse and repeat until you get to the end. Not a lot of depth, but
there's a Zen feeling in figuring out the shortest path to each ore. It's important that you
can't drill upwards, since if you drill poorly, you can easily make it much harder to mine
the ore you want. It's just enough thinking to stop it from being totally mindless.

My main issue with the game is that dying has an insane penalty. If you die, you go back to
your last save point, but all drilled holes will be reset. So if you die in the late game,
get ready to hold down for several minutes to get back to where you were before. This wouldn't
be so bad if gas pockets weren't a thing. After a certain depth, dirt blocks will randomly
have gas pockets. You're warned about them once, but the game doesn't emphasize how
destructive they can be. Gas pockets are 100% undetectable, can't be avoided, do massive amounts of damage,
and are a one-hit kill if you don't have enough HP and defense upgrades. Meanwhile, the game
heavily incentivizes digging deeper. Rare ores appear more often at high depths and each tier
trades in for much more than the previous one. So basically, gas pockets are just an
invisible stat check and players don't know they exist until they hit it.

Once you know how to deal with gas pockets, the game doesn't have many surprises, and it's
pretty easy to reach the end in a practically invincible state.


Shift series
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Shift series is based around one concept.

There are a few games in the series. The first one is a good showcase of the idea, but in retrospect,
the puzzle gameplay isn't very good. A lot of the levels have a problem where there's one clear
move at the start, then after you do that there's another clear move, and another one after that,
and then you hit the exit door without ever thinking about how to get there. Later games in
the series get better about this.
