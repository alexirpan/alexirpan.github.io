*Sorta Insightful* turns eight years old today!

I am writing this while traveling and sick with COVID, which is the clearest sign that I am in this
for the long haul. I don't remember where it's from, but long ago I remember reading
a novelist's guide for how to write a novel. It had a bunch of typical advice,
but ended with "realistically, the successful authors I know didn't need help
to start writing, they just needed support to keep going.
Sometimes the way to write a novel is to **just go write a f\*\*\*ing novel**"

I suppose that's where I'm at with this blog.

# Highlights

I'm done with writing MIT Mystery Hunt! Freedommmmmmmm.

I also wrote a [post]({% post_url 2023-04-21-mh-2023 %}) about it, although
"post" may be the wrong word. Credit to CJ for noting that the post was long
enough to pass [NaNoWriMo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Novel_Writing_Month). Did it need to be that long? Eh, probably not, but I kept having ideas I wanted to put in. I also knew I was not in a mood to revise
it to be shorter. The revisions I did were focused on grammar, word choice,
and overall flow, rather than deciding if an idea should be cut. (Feel free to
draw a comparison to the Hunt itself if you want.)

To be honest, I do not expect to write a post of that length again. I started
working on that post right after Mystery Hunt 2023 finished, and hardcore
grinded on getting it out ASAP. "As soon as possible" turned out to be 3 months,
ending right when planning for ABCDE:FG ramped up. The end result was that I was
exerting "write Mystery Hunt" levels of effort (10-20 hrs/week) for 1.5 years
straight instead of 1 year straight. That was just too much, and I burned
out hard.

My burnout lined up almost
*exactly* when my Switch arrived with a copy of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.
Let's say my escapism into TotK was especially therapeutic. I'm done with the
game now, but am still adjusting to not having a "default" action taking up
mindshare.
"I should write a puzzle", "I should write about writing puzzles", or
"I should go find more Koroks" have been like, the only three thoughts I've had outside
of work since last year. Gotta have more thoughts than those!

# Statistics

## Posts

I wrote 6 posts this year, down from 7 last year. In my defense, one was very long.
This is clearer if I pull up...

## Time Spent

I spent **188 hours, 24 minutes** writing for my blog this year, around 1.9x as
long as last year.

Around 170 hours of that was on the [Mystery Hunt retrospective]({% post_url 2023-04-21-mh-2023 %}) post.

# Posts in Limbo

**Post about Dominion Online:**

Odds of writing this year: 5%  
Odds of writing eventually: 25%

My priorities are moving away from Dominion. This may be the first year I skip the yearly championship, I'm not too interested in grinding my skill level back up. Still, I can't let go of writing it eventually.

**Post about Dustforce:**

Odds of writing this year: 20%  
Odds of writing eventually: 60%

I still think this is one of the best platformers of all time.

**Post about puzzlehunting 201:**

Odds of writing this year: 50%  
Odds of writing eventually: 90%

This is a post I've been considering for a while. There are [introduction to puzzlehunt](https://blog.vero.site/post/puzzlehunts) posts, a "puzzlehunt 101", but there is no
"puzzlehunting 201" for people familiar with the basics and interested in solving faster.
I was considering writing this post last year
and embedding puzzle content in it for Mystery Hunt, but didn't have a solid puzzle idea.
I may just write it without embedding a puzzle in it.

**Post about AI timelines:**

Odds of writing this year: 90%  
Odds of writing eventually: 99%

I'm not planning a big update to the last timelines [post]({% post_url 2020-08-18-ai-timelines %}). I just think it's time to review what I proposed, given that it's been 3 years.
(And selfishly, because I think I called a lot of things correctly.)
