I've been dreading writing this post, although perhaps not for the reasons you'd expect.

I've been watching My Little Pony for literally 10 years. **10 years.** Good lord that's
a long time. I started in the gap between Season 1 and 2, and although many people I
know from that time stopped watching, I...didn't. Friendship is Magic (Gen 4) officially ended
2 years ago, Hasbro already launched Generation 5 with a Netflix movie, and I'm still here.

Despite this, off the top of my head I've only been asked why I watch MLP three times.
Three times in 10 years! It's not like I advertise it, but I also don't try to hide it, and
I am eternally thankful to live in a culture bubble where people genuinely don't care (or
at least don't treat it as a disqualifying character trait).

When I *have* answered this question, I've usually said something like "it's a wholesome,
well-animated cartoon, that shifts between funny slice-of-life and adventures where the fate of the
world is at stake. The writing doesn't always hit, but it is good on average, and the best
episodes are *really* good." That's all *true*, but the real reason I kept watching the
show was because of the brony community around it. So to explain why my
YouTube recommendations are full of MLP music, I have to explain the fandom and my relation to it
first.

And boy is that complicated.

2010-2011: The Beginning
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The first thing to explain about My Little Pony is that it was never supposed to be as successful
as it is now.

Before Friendship is Magic, I think people thought of My Little Pony as a low-quality cartoon that
was only successful because it got little girls to buy more toys. That's...probably true. I
haven't watched much MLP prior to the Friendship is Magic reboot, but the few clips I've
seen have not been good.

I didn't get on the fandom train until Season 2, but here is the apocryphal story I learned about
the brony fandom's origins. It started from 4chan, specifically the /co/ board about comics and
cartoons. (Like many things, 4chan is best learned at a distance, rather than experienced
first hand.) Lauren Faust, showrunner for *The Powerpuff Girls* and
*Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends*, was announced as the lead for an upcoming MLP reboot.
One poster is *pissed*, mad enough to write an entire essay whose thesis is that Lauren Faust is a
great cartoon showrunner that sold out by agreeing to work on a cartoon that's a glorified toy
commercial. They are convinced this is the end of the world. (Where "the world" means "the work
of a well-known animator, if you're into animation enough to track who creates each show". Small
world.) They expect that any artistic talent from Faust's direction is going to get smothered by
corporate suits who don't understand animation as an art form.

This essay gets enough traction that a few anons decide they're going to ironically
hate-watch My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic as soon as it comes out. Get some free Internet
points by shitting on trash. That sort of thing. They get a few episodes in and realize, with
dawning horror, that they are changing from ironic hate-watchers to ironic fans to true fans.
Popularity spreads in 4chan. The mods have to create a /mlp/ containment board to stop MLP
discussion from crowding out the serious and dignified discussion of other cartoons. It spills
out from 4chan into the real world and soon takes on a life of its own.

At the very last BronyCon, Lauren Faust (who had moved on from the show) came back to do a panel
with M. A. Larson, one of the lead writers who still tours the MLP convention circuit. During the
Q&A section, an audience member asked when the two of them knew they had something special.
Larson said he learned when Lauren shared a video of a bunch of Russian men, some dressed in
military camo, singing along to *Winter Wrap-Up*.

I've heard it described as a "lightning in a bottle" scenario. In most reasonable words, Friendship is
Magic is a quietly successful cartoon that sells a bunch of toys, but is otherwise unremarkable.
Make no mistake, it is a good show, but good shows don't necessarily lead to large fandoms. Virality
can be hard to predict.

I think the reason it grew so big was that the premise was incredibly novel. Not the premise of the show:
the premise of the fandom. "Several men, age 15 to 30, swear up and down that the new My Little Pony
show is worth watching" was such a strange idea that it convinced people to try watching the show.
The meme was contagious enough to get people to overcome their existing aversions to watching a cartoon
marketed towards 7 year old girls, and every pony avatar and pony edit created afterwards fed the cycle.
When people talk about the "golden age" of the brony fandom, they usually mean fan work from this time.

Why My Little Pony, Friendship is Magic
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Friendship is Magic is not a perfect show. Hoooo boy does it have flaws. But it's a guilty pleasure that's
fun once you get into it.

As mentioned earlier, it's well animated, and the character designs are cute in the anime-style
"big eyes" way. However, underlying the surface level sweet appeal is a surprising level of
worldbuilding. Friendship is Magic is the type of show that's a little smarter than you expect it
to be from its premise. Sure, it's a advertising vehicle to sell toys, but it's a well-made
advertising vehicle. It subscribes to the philosophy of "make a good show and people will come".

The show is primarily a slice of life show that's light on continuity. Some members of the Mane 6 (NAMES) get into a situation,
supported by side characters, and hijinks ensue. They all have strengths and flaws, and when written
well, the ponies bounce off each other and are really entertaining or touching. It's not just
stuff like "let's go to the store!", there are real conflicts and resolutions. Especially in the
later seasons, these conflicts can be very relatable to adults. For example, there's an episode
about a pony who started dating a single mom. The mom has a daughter, and she hates him - the episode
is about him trying to find a way to relate to her. That's a more extreme example, but there are
others like that.

Every now and then (usually around the season premiere and finale), the show drops the slice of life,
and turns into a high stakes adventure where the fate of the world is at stake. This tends to be
heavier on continuity, involves a lot more fighting and power of friendship speeches, and basically
turns into a magical girl anime. But you know, with ponies.
