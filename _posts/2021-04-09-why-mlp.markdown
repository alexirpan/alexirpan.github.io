I've been dreading writing this post, although perhaps not for the reasons you'd expect.

I've been watching My Little Pony for literally 10 years. **10 years.** Good lord that's
a long time. I started in the gap between Season 1 and 2, and although many people I
know from that time stopped watching, I...didn't. Friendship is Magic (Gen 4) officially ended
2 years ago, they've already started putting out Gen 5 material, and I'm still here.

Despite this, off the top of my head I've only been asked why I watch MLP three times.
Three times in 10 years! It's not like I advertise it, but I also don't try to hide it, and
I am eternally thankful to live in a culture bubble where people genuinely don't care (or
at least don't treat it as a disqualifying character trait).

When I *have* answered this question, I've usually said something like, "it's well
animated and very cute", or "it's an ensemble show with good character dynamics", or
"it makes me smile, and do I need another reason?" And this is all *true* but they don't
fully explain why my YouTube recommendations are full of MLP music.

So let me answer this question two ways. The short way that doesn't answer it, and the long
way that does.

Why My Little Pony, Friendship is Magic
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Friendship is Magic is not a perfect show. Hoooo boy does it have flaws. But it's a guilty pleasure that's
fun once you get into it.

As mentioned earlier, it's well animated, and the character designs are cute in the anime-style
"big eyes" way. However, underlying the surface level sweet appeal is a surprising level of
worldbuilding. Friendship is Magic is the type of show that's a little smarter than you expect it
to be from its premise. Sure, it's a advertising vehicle to sell toys, but it's a well-made
advertising vehicle. It subscribes to the philosophy of "make a good show and people will come".

The show is primarily a slice of life show that's light on continuity. Some members of the Mane 6 (NAMES) get into a situation,
supported by side characters, and hijinks ensue. They all have strengths and flaws, and when written
well, the ponies bounce off each other and are really entertaining or touching. It's not just
stuff like "let's go to the store!", there are real conflicts and resolutions. Especially in the
later seasons, these conflicts can be very relatable to adults. For example, there's an episode
about a pony who started dating a single mom. The mom has a daughter, and she hates him - the episode
is about him trying to find a way to relate to her. That's a more extreme example, but there are
others like that.

Every now and then (usually around the season premiere and finale), the show drops the slice of life,
and turns into a high stakes adventure where the fate of the world is at stake. This tends to be
heavier on continuity, involves a lot more fighting and power of friendship speeches, and basically
turns into a magical girl anime. But you know, with ponies.

The first thing to explain about My Little Pony, is that it was never supposed to become
as big as it did.

The common story goes like this: Lauren Faust, showrunner for *The Powerpuff Girls* and
*Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends*, is announced to be the showrunner for the upcoming
generation of My Little Pony. The MLP franchise has run since the 80s, and each TV show is
split into different "generations" - every now and then, the show is cancelled, and rebooted
with new canon.

The vast majority of people do not give a shit. They don't care, they don't know this is happening.
A small group of Powerpuff Girls fans are upset, because My Little Pony's reputation is as
far down as it can be - a mediocre show with no redeeming qualities besides excessive sugar,
selling toys to girls that don't know better. (something about how powerpuff girls was
the opposite of this and somewhat feminist, etc. etc.)

This gets traction on 4chan, for whatever reason (back in the day, where 4chan was still very
degenerate, but its alt-right aspects hadn't spilled over into the mainstream). As 4chan
does, people said they'd watch MLP ironically. They'd hate-watch it. They'd subject themselves
to misery and document their torture for the Internet's amusement. Such is the 4chan way.

Some people hated it. A lot more liked it. That's where things get weird.

At the very last BronyCon, Lauren Faust and M. A. Larson had a panel. And when asked when they
knew what they had started, they said they knew something was going on when 4chan was talking
about them in a positive way. But they *really* knew it was real when they saw a video of
beefy Russian dudes dancing to *Winter Wrap-Up*

Every episode snowballed into more fans, more fan content, people making pony GIFs and
pony avatars on forums. The word was spreading - there's a new MLP cartoon, and it's actually good.

And that's where I come in.
