I've really put off writing this post.

I've been watching My Little Pony for literally 10 years. **10 years.** Good lord that's
a long time. I started in the gap between Season 1 and 2, and although many people I
know from that time stopped watching, I...didn't. Friendship is Magic (Gen 4) officially ended
2 years ago, Hasbro already launched Generation 5 with a Netflix movie, and I'm still here.

Despite this, off the top of my head I've only been asked why I watch MLP three times.
Three times in 10 years! It's not like I advertise it, but I also don't try to hide it, and
I am eternally thankful to live in a culture bubble where people genuinely don't care (or
at least don't treat it as a disqualifying character trait).

When I *have* answered this question, I've usually said something like "it's a wholesome,
well-animated cartoon, that shifts between funny slice-of-life and adventures where the fate of the
world is at stake. The writing doesn't always hit, but it is good on average, and the best
episodes are *really* good." That's all *true*, but the real reason I kept watching the
show was because of the brony community around it. I've been around fandom for a long time, and to
explain why I'm subscribed to a brony music label, I feel like I have to justify my feelings on
fandom in general. And *boy* is that complicated.

"Fans are Great. Fandom is Weird"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The quote above is attributed to Terry Pratchett, but I've yet to find a primary source. MLP fandom
is no different, but even for fandom, it swings pretty hard on the weird scale. In terms of how hard
the fandom goes, it's up in the Homestuck / Undertale tier. It's funny the fandom exists at all, because
it was never supposed to be that successful.

Before Friendship is Magic, I think people thought of My Little Pony as a low-quality cartoon that
was only successful because it got little girls to buy more toys. That's...probably true. I
hadn't watched any MLP prior to the Friendship is Magic reboot, but the few clips I've seen have
ranged from mediocre to aggressively insulting. Like, I feel bad for the kids who grew up on it.

Why was My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic different? Part of it is that it's a genuinely good show.
Sure, it's an advertising vehicle to sell toys, but it's a well-made advertising vehicle. The character
designs are cute in the anime way, and underneath the surface level wholesomeness is a surprising level of
worldbuilding and depth. It subscribes to the philosophy of "make a good show, and people will pay money for
it".

Sometimes, people derisively refer to something as a "kid's show". I don't think they really mean "shows where kids are
the primary demographic can't be good". What they mean by "kid's show" is a show that relies on flashy explosions, bright
colors, and crazy visuals, rather than interesting personalities, character dynamics, and clever jokes.
That isn't to say good shows can't have explosions (see: Mythbusters), but
explosions alone can't fix a broken narrative.
Characters in MLP aren't always well written (good *lord* they are not), but when they are, it creates
really excellent tension and payoff.

Fans often attribute the characters to Lauren Faust's influence as a showrunner, thanks to her prior work
on *The Powerpuff Girls* and *Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends*. It's pretty unclear how much that
matches reality, but that's the creation myth for the fandom. According to legend,
in 2010 there was a 4chan thread about Lauren Faust getting to lead
the Generation 4 My Little Pony reboot. (I've never gone looking for the thread
- my philospophy is that it's best to never directly observe 4chan.)
The thread creator is *pissed*, writing
an entire essay whose thesis was "Lauren Faust is a great showrunner that's
sold out to work on a glorified toy commercial". Lamenting the death of
animation as an art form, a few anons decide to ironically
hate-watch My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic when it comes out.
Get some free Internet points by shitting on trash. They get a few episodes in and realize, with
dawning horror, that they are changing from ironic hate-watchers to ironic fans to true fans.
Popularity spreads in 4chan. The mods have to create a /mlp/ containment board to stop MLP
discussion from crowding out the serious and dignified discussion of other cartoons. It spills
out from 4chan into the real world and soon takes on a life of its own. Lauren
Faust moved on from the show after Season 2, but by then there was no going back.

I've heard it described as a "lightning in a bottle" scenario. In most realities,
Friendship is Magic is a quietly successful cartoon that sells a bunch of toys,
sparks a bit of nostalgia, and is otherwise unremarkable. Quality is no guarantee
of fandom and virality can be hard to predict.
At the very last BronyCon, Lauren Faust came back to do a panel
with M. A. Larson, a lead writer who still tours the MLP convention circuit. In
the Q&A section, he discussed a video Lauren shared during Season 1, where a
bunch of Russian men, some dressed in military camo, were singing along to
*Winter Wrap-Up*, and although he knew something was happening, that was the
moment where he realized this was real.

Okay, But Actually, Why My Little Pony?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There's a lot of theories as to why Friendship is Magic became so viral so quickly.

The premise was incredibly novel. Not the premise of the show:
the premise of the fandom. "Several 15 to 30 year old men swear up and down that the new My Little Pony
show is worth watching" was such a strange, bizarre idea that it got people to overcome their
existing aversions towards watching a cartoon marketed towards 7 year old girls.

Its aims of teaching kids how to navigate friendships and tricky social
situations were relatable to adults as well. It may have been warped by the
characters being ponies, but episodes whose morals are "don't promise your friends
too much" and "don't get jealous about your friends' good fortune" struck a chord
with adults as well. (Or more cynically, less socially adjusted people found it
easier to learn these lessons from a cartoon rather than a society that scolded
them when they did something "wrong" without getting told why.)

CHECK FROM DIYANG, but fandom is driven most by untapped potential. Poorly
written episodes inspire fanfic to fix them. Worldbuilding details never fully
explained are great inspiration points for fanart. 

That was how I
got into it, and every pony avatar and pony edit created afterwards fed the cycle.
When people talk about the "golden age" of the brony fandom, they usually mean fan work from this time.
I legitimately think [Ponycraft 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJbAT1wzS8U) still holds up today
as an MLP edit of the Starcraft II trailer.

The way I see fan content in general is that it's like painting a tapestry, but instead of the standard
colors like red and blue, you get more exotic colors like Papyrus or Reimu. This makes it much harder
for other people to appreciate the art, but if you understand the references, it lets the work
convey much more specific feelings and ideas.

My Little Pony has a very, *very* deep well of characterization, as well as untapped potential in its
worldbuilding. There's a lot of options in the creativity sandbox without ever straying too far from
MLP canon. So when the MLP fandom does something, it goes **hard**. Make a 9 hour Ace Attorney x MLP
crossover video series? Sure, why not - they talk slow but the resolution of the case is excellent.
There are countless examples of fans spending tons of time making something purely for other bronies,
and although Sturgeon's Law applies, there's *so much* fan content that the 10% good is plentiful,
and the top 1% is exceptional. I've grown a little tired of the Fallout Equestria verse, but the
original is still a nice case study in how to write a protagonist who use all their abilities
to their limit.



Backlash
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Your Words Have No Power
---------------------------------------------------------------

One thing I'll always remember from my high school history teachers is that when you have one
culture / social niche, there's always a counterculture that forms and defines itself against it.
Brony culture is no different, and it got hit especially bad because.

1. It was a viral meme, so tons of people knew about it.
2. It was adjacent to the furry community, which was already the laughing stock of the Internet.
3. Even ignoring that, it was super easy to make fun of bronies.

In some personality models, there's a dimension for "openness to experience". Meaning, how willing are
you to try new things and put yourself in unfamiliar situations? Deciding to watch MLP as a grown up
is a pretty blatant declaration that you're willing to try new things, and I think that scared
people who couldn't believe or accept that someone would find a cartoon entertaining, even if it
was about pastel-colored horses. I never had to go through this myself, but I know lots of people
had to justify why they found the show entertaining, either to their friends, or to themselves.

And similarly, it shouldn't be surprising that self-secure bronies would take that backlash or
contradiction and wear it as a source of pride.
There is a grand tradition of groups taking slurs and adopting them for themselves. ["Queer"](https://www.cjr.org/language_corner/queer.php)
used to be used in contempt. Now it's part of the LGBTQ acronym. There aren't really similar slurs
for the brony community, but there is a similar level of hate, and I'd say many bronies (myself included)
felt a sense of strength in numbers.

Mihaela Popa-Wyatt [has written some essays about times groups repurpose slurs](https://philarchive.org/archive/POPRTB).
The theory is that slurs are way to assign low power to a group. (You do not deserve to be named the way
you want to be.) When a group reclaims a slur and uses it to self-label themselves, it disarms the attack




Why My Little Pony, Friendship is Magic
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Friendship is Magic is not a perfect show. Hoooo boy does it have flaws. But it's a guilty pleasure that's
fun once you get into it.

The show is primarily a slice of life show that's light on continuity. Some members of the Mane 6 (NAMES) get into a situation,
supported by side characters, and hijinks ensue. They all have strengths and flaws, and when written
well, the ponies bounce off each other and are really entertaining or touching. It's not just
stuff like "let's go to the store!", there are real conflicts and resolutions. Especially in the
later seasons, these conflicts can be very relatable to adults. For example, there's an episode
about a pony who started dating a single mom. The mom has a daughter, and she hates him - the episode
is about him trying to find a way to relate to her. That's a more extreme example, but there are
others like that.

Every now and then (usually around the season premiere and finale), the show drops the slice of life,
and turns into a high stakes adventure where the fate of the world is at stake. This tends to be
heavier on continuity, involves a lot more fighting and power of friendship speeches, and basically
turns into a magical girl anime. But you know, with ponies.

Things to cover:

* MLP fan music scene
* mandarinorange PMVs / SimGretina, people leaving the community out of shame or bad feelings, pony archive project.
* "hey follow my new work"
* Tension between people creating overt pony references and pony inspired work.
* "At least we're still relevant enough to be made fun of"
* The way in which peope took degeneracy / the disgust of others as a point of pride, that other
 people didn't "get it".
* The whole "join the herd" and the whoe cult-like obsessions (but the joke is that most people
are in the joke)
* The occasional alt-right tendencies, and how this is most exaggerated at the conventions which
are the most concentrated form of people who don't fit into society (whether through neurodivergence,
not knowing how to relate to people, etc.)
* "Fandoms don't die, they just slow down"
* The shift from hipster-ism to just treating it as a normal thing.
* Big fish in a small pond, vanity pond, fighting for clout, Phil Fish video.
* PonyTown, PonyFest concert.
* Fandom as a means of escapism from a cruel world (for people who don't find something in the world that gives them meaning, fan work can create its own meaning.)
* Is Fandom good/bad? My sense is that it's at times distasteful and weird, but is less destructive than
other things - it is better than it meant something, even if it ended in pain, rather than not meaning
anything at all. As for whether one fandom is better or worse than another one, that depends on if you can
live with its ethos.
* Accepting a label with all its baggage. "i'm not a brony, but I watch MLP", "i'm not a furry but I
understand why some people are", etc.

Things I want to work up to:

A lot of brony conventions run BronyPalooza, a concert series where musicians in the fandom play music. Usually,
they don't even play showtunes. At best they play songs that have MLP inspiration, but which wouldn't be out
of place on a generic indie music album. Because pony is what brought people together, but it's not the reason
everyone stays.

Usually, these events suck. You get a bunch of awkward dancers, in a room that's far too big, and no one's brave
enough to dance. The BronyPalooza at the last BronyCon? The Last Ride? It was *lit*. It was packed at 2 AM, and if
it weren't for the MLP visuals and person waving a full size Equestrian flag, it wouldn't be out of place from
a run-of-the-mill nightclub.

Behind me is an impromptu conga line, and the person at the end of it yells "Come on, JOIN US! IT'S OKAY! We're
all retarded." Between the insane circumstances, and the casual self-directed use of "retard" in the year 2019, I'm
not sure I could give a better summary of the MLP community.

\* \* \*

Extremism tends to attract extremism. Not because they seek each other, but because by definition, the extremists have
a hard time in normal social circles. There is a reason some people use "normies" as a slur, and if all the low-openness
people get weirded out, only the weird ones are left - and yes, that sometimes means Black Lives Matters and Blue Lives
Matters folk live under the same umbrella of MLP fandom, each blissfully unaware of the others politics until things come
to a head.

I've seen it all. Aggressively nonbinary and transgender people finding solace in changelings (a race of shapeshifters)
and criticizing anyone to the right of Bernie Sanders.
People trying to defend an OC of white supremacy by saying "it's just an edgy joke", and then immediately lamenting that
the fandom has actual white supremecists (without realizing that sometimes it's not worth joking about some things).

Sure, a lot of us are a little self-conscious about our dumb fandom. But if people are going to make fun of us, we want
them to make fun of us for liking a show about ponies.

Equestria Daily does a reasonably frequent call-out of when other media references MLP or the brony subculture. They once
talked about (CHECK THIS) the Teen Titans Go! movie, where a brony was portrayed as an obese white man that was clearly
meant to be read as a loser. EQD's commentary was "at least we're still relevant enough to be made fun of".

I've thought about those words a lot. I feel I see echos of that everywhere. Felix (LAST NAME), talking about being an
MMA fan, and how they couldn't explain how the magic of the octagon gave disaffected men an arena where real heroics
and villainy could happen, outside the confines of a brutal corporation society. A Smash documentary, where a commentator
talks about how Melee locals are their churches, and a former pro talks about how they didn't find themselves in Smash, but
they found a second self in Smash. A documentary on Phil Fish, a notoriously controversial indie game developer, looking
at the reshare counts of an article he's in, saying "I don't know why I care so much".

I feel like everyone's looking for community, or meaning, or just *something*, *anything* that helps cure their
existentialism, and if that comes from horse conventions? Well, it's weird...but I'm not sure I can say it's bad. Fandom
is the engine that creates meaning, and more meaning seems better than none.

\* \* \*

You run into problems when you meet the people whose entire identity is wrapped up in a single subculture. That's how
you get people planning real-life power outages to disrupt an EVE Online clan. A person calling another a wanna-be
dictator for blocking people they don't like on Twitter. The infamous Steven Universe fandom incident. So on and so forth.
It would be easy to lay this at the feet of certain fandoms, but the problem is more of intensity rather than source
material, and intensity tends to wane over time. The crazy Homestuck fans moved to MLP, and then to Steven Universe,
and then to Undertale and then to Hazbin Hotel and then...well, I think I'm getting too old to spectate them anymore,
but I heard The Owl House is getting some buzz.

In some ways, I'm actually kinda happy the fandom slowed down. Sure, there's less content, and it's less fun watching
creators leave every year, but the people left are a bit older and more self-aware that none of this *actually* matters.
It was fun watching someone set up a "your waifu is trash, change my mind" table, or seeing the shrine of discarded
MLP toys grow larger and larger over the course of BronyCon, and watching the fandom get less acrimonious about
content creators moving on to other things.
