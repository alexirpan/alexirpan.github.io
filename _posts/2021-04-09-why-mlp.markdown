You'd be surprised how infrequently people ask me this question.

Off the top of my head, I only remember it happening three times. Not that much, given that
I've been following MLP for almost 10 years. Most people I know either make fun of it in
a joking way, or genuinely don't care.

When I *have* had to answer this question, I've usually said something like, "it's well
animated and very cute", or "it's an ensemble cast with good character dynamics", or
"it makes me smile, and do I need another reason?" But I don't think they actually get to
why I like the show, and why I'm still listening to MLP music all this time layer, 2 years
after the show's ended.

No, the real reason is complicated. *Really* complicated.

Let's begin.

The first thing to explain about My Little Pony, is that it was never supposed to become
as big as it did.

The common story goes like this: Lauren Faust, showrunner for *The Powerpuff Girls* and
*Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends*, is announced to be the showrunner for the upcoming
generation of My Little Pony. The MLP franchise has run since the 80s, and each TV show is
split into different "generations" - every now and then, the show is cancelled, and rebooted
with new canon.

The vast majority of people do not give a shit. They don't care, they don't know this is happening.
A small group of Powerpuff Girls fans are upset, because My Little Pony's reputation is as
far down as it can be - a mediocre show with no redeeming qualities besides excessive sugar,
selling toys to girls that don't know better. (something about how powerpuff girls was
the opposite of this and somewhat feminist, etc. etc.)

This gets traction on 4chan, for whatever reason (back in the day, where 4chan was still very
degenerate, but its alt-right aspects hadn't spilled over into the mainstream). As 4chan
does, people said they'd watch MLP ironically. They'd hate-watch it. They'd subject themselves
to misery and document their torture for the Internet's amusement. Such is the 4chan way.

Some people hated it. A lot more liked it. That's where things get weird.

At the very last BronyCon, Lauren Faust and M. A. Larson had a panel. And when asked when they
knew what they had started, they said they knew something was going on when 4chan was talking
about them in a positive way. But they *really* knew it was real when they saw a video of
beefy Russian dudes dancing to *Winter Wrap-Up*

Every episode snowballed into more fans, more fan content, people making pony GIFs and
pony avatars on forums. The word was spreading - there's a new MLP cartoon, and it's actually good.

And that's where I come in.
