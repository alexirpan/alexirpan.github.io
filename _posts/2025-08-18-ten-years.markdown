My blog turns ten years old today. The big 1-0. If you've been here from the
beginning, thanks.

Every now and then, someone asks me why I blog, and I don't know really know
what to tell them. I like writing and I had things to tell? There was a fire
and I needed to stoke it? Something around there is approximately correct,
but it doesn't feel like the full story.

I think what feels closer is that a long time ago, I was looking for outlets
to express myself creatively. Drawing didn't appeal to me, creating weird
programming widgets didn't either, and that left longform writing as the natural
option. So I started, and after I got everything going, it was easier to keep
going rather than stop. (If anything, I think I have a harder time stopping
things than starting things.)

Maybe that's why it doesn't feel like a big deal to cross the ten year mark.
It's just like, yeah, this is a thing I do, which I want to keep doing. Why would
it feel special to do something I liked doing for 10 years? In life, I try to
keep doing things I enjoy. Seems like a good policy, that's all.

I think it also helps that I take this blog *profoundly* unseriously. When
I wrote my last post, about [brony musicians seizing the means of production]({% post_url 2025-07-21-babscon-2025 %}),
I decided to ask an LLM for feedback. I prompted it to be honest and harsh in
its criticism, and it told me:

* Your post is too meandering.
* You have too many personal anecdotes that aren't relevant to the main story.
* You've buried the lede, get rid of half the words.

On reflection, it wasn't *wrong* that the post would be better without
all the little frills I'd written into it. But I *wanted* the
frills. So I took half its advice, and ignored the rest. The upside and downside
of being your own editor.

In a world of Substacks and Mediums, it feels good to have this corner of the Internet,
outside the storm of platforms and monetization, where I can write 6600 words
about My Little Pony and not feel bad about it. So, really, thanks.

# Stats

I spent 93 hours, 7 minutes writing 6 posts this year, which is down from 139 hours + 9 posts from last year.

Once again, I wish I could say I had a good reason for this, but the reality
is that I got a new laptop, and the laptop came with a free 3 month subscription
to Xbox Game Pass. So that turned on the engineer brain of "I need to maximize the value", and I spent much of those 3 months playing all the Game Pass games I could.
By the end, I was frankly pretty disappointed in how I'd spent my time, and decided
not to renew it, but the damage was done, and the writing habit never really came back.

I want to be doing more writing, so I'm hoping the numbers trend back up this year.
I also want to try some weirder stuff.
One thing I've realized is that I've fallen into a groove with my writing. I did
a lot more weird one-offs when I started blogging, but now I know there's a style
to my posts and it's easy to just stick within that genre. I want to try innovating
it, play a bit more with the craft of writing. Ten years is as good a time as any
to try something new.

# Video Game Reviews

Look, if Xbox Game Pass took over 3 months of my life, I'm going to at least get some content out of it.

**UFO 50**: This wasn't part of Xbox Game Pass, but it was the game I played the most last year.
A great game if you're the kind of person who likes video games. If you're new? Start somewhere else.
There's a very particular thing going on in playing through the evolution of a fictional video game
studio, that makes you appreciate video game design all the more. There are many games I've barely even
tried, but I still have so many hours in the ones I did. Mini & Max is GOATed and worth the
price of admission on its own.

**Starcraft II Campaign**: In a past life, I played a lot of Stacraft, enough to know I sucked at it
and to appreciate the pros who didn't. Coming back, I've learned I still suck at this game, but beating
up the AI is still fun. I think unfortunately it only ever made it to "okay" though. The story of Starcraft
II starts out strong in Wings of Liberty, but gets incredibly bad in Heart of the Swarm. Legacy of the
Void redeems it a bit, and then the finale falls all the way back down again. Gameplay wise, it
was fun for a while, but at some point rebuilding a base and deathball every game felt like a chore
instead of play.

**Indiana Jones and the Great Circle**: I don't know how they did it, but Indiana Jones and the Great
Circle was just fun all the way through. I got surprisingly invested in the story, it's voiced well,
and the gameplay has a nice balance of exploration, puzzle solving, stealth, and frantically using
your whip on Nazis when the stealth inevitably goes wrong. My one complaint is that the hand-to-hand
combat feels like the worst part of the game, so of course a bunch of sidequests are gated behind
learning parry timings you'll never use later.

**Another Crab's Treasure**: The devs of Another Crab's Treasure are now most famous for Peak, their
small side project which is now their main project after it sold 5 million copies. I have not tried
Peak, but Another Crab's Treasure was really good and is worth playing if you're interested in
a Souls-like. I've been told it's easier than other Souls-likes, but what really carries it is the
game's humor and story. In between the typical story of a dying world is a series of jabs against
pollution and the externalities capitalism.

**Chants of Sennar**: A short language-based puzzle game themed after the Tower of Babel, where you
need to learn how to translate between languages to help people communicate with each other and
ascend the tower. I will always shill Return of the Obra Dinn and this felt very like that game,
complete with me doing some brute force to resolve a few words I just didn't get. Would recommend.

**Superliminal**: I remember seeing the trailer for this game a long time ago, and people talking it
up as a Portal-like first person puzzle game. This game...is not Portal. It's really not. I mean,
I don't regret playing it, but I'm definitely glad I played it for free on Game Pass rather than
buying it. A lot of the set pieces were just okay rather than exceptional, and there are only so many
tricks to pull out of the perspective toolbox. Doesn't overstay its welcome but also didn't have a
lasting impression on me.

**Gris**: A very pretty game with good music that's lacking in gameplay. Don't get me wrong, the
gameplay exists, but the game is much more about absorbing the vibe of the world and solving some
light traversal puzzles rather than overcoming some great challenge. The character you're playing
as is going through something, but that doesn't mean you are. Another game I don't regret playing
but which I'm glad I played for free.
