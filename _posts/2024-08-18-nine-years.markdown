*Sorta Insightful* turns nine years old today!

# Highlights

I was expecting to have more free time for writing this year. I did have more
free time, but I ended up spending it on other things.

The main reason I've had more free time is that I stopped writing puzzles.
Puzzle writing has been one of my main recent hobbies, but I've found the problem
is that I can't do low key puzzlehunt writing. I either go all-in or I don't,
and when I go all-in, it takes up enough headspace that I struggle to do other
things. This year was a year I needed to do other things.

And I did do other things! There are some silent changes I did in the backend
(both Google Analytics and my time tracker got deprecated this year), but the
most notable change is that I [switched career trajectories to AI safety]({% post_url 2024-08-06-switching-to-ai-safety %}).

I try to keep my Twitter / X usage low, but I retweet all posts whenever I write
them, and I've noticed my switch into AI safety post has had significantly more
Twitter engagement than my other posts. I've chalked this up to "the alignment mafia" - a distributed
set of people who reshare and promote anything supporting their views on AGI.
Listen, I appreciate the support, but I haven't done anything yet! Chill.

The time it took me to navigate my career change was much less than the time I
spent writing puzzles last year. So what did I fill the void with in its place?

...Video games. It was video games. Pardon me, while I go into a quick review:

* Hi-Fi Rush starts slow but gets great once you unlock all the battle mechanics.
It's colorful and joyous, filled with fantastic set pieces.
* Islands of Insight is...fine? It pitched itself as a puzzle-based MMO, where its
highlight is a huge set of handmade Nikoli logic puzzles in an explorable world.
The puzzles are good, but the game is poorly optimized, the social MMO aspects
are pretty minimal, and there's a huge pile of skill trees that feels like it's
just there to encourage higher engagement, rather than being more fun. I am down
on a lot of the game, but the puzzles are great.
* Undertale Yellow is a fantastic fan game, that's been in development for 7 years
and comes out feeling like a canon entry made by Toby Fox. I have small nitpicks
about the lack of variety in pacifist boss strategies, but the overall package
works. I would have gladly paid money for this, but it's free, if you liked Undertale
check it out.
* Hades 2 came out, which was a great excuse to play Hades 1. I bought Hades 1 three
years ago and never installed it. I got around to playing it and pushed up to
Epilogue, all weapon aspects, and 21 heat before setting it down. At some point, it does get easy to
fall into the builds you know are overpowered, but that's the fate of every roguelike.
What Hades 1 does well is make you feel overpowered when you get a good run going - and
then killing you regardless if you don't respect the bosses enough.
The part I don't like is how grindy the story progression gets by the end, but most
players will not reach that point.
* Incremental games were a mistake, do not recommend.
If you're unfamiliar with the genre, *Cookie Clicker* is the
prototypical example. You start with a small number of resources, then achieve
exponentially larger resources through increasingly complicated progression and
automation systems. I tried one of the highly recommended ones, and no joke, it took
up *4 months* of my life. If you are the kind of person who likes theorycrafting
stat builds to maximize damage throughput, incremental games are a game where
you only do that. Except, instead of maximizing damage, you're minimizing
time-to-unlock the next progression layer. I was spending 3 hours a day to get
my game to a state where I could maximize my overnight stat gain. It felt a lot
like machine learning work, where you try to get everything done so that you can
let the model train overnight and inspect it next morning. The experience was
interesting, but it wasn't worth the cost.

# Posts in Limbo

You know, looking back, I did end up writing a lot of the posts I was thinking
of writing.

**Post about Dominion:**

Odds of writing this year: 5%  
Odds of writing eventually: 10%

I haven't touched my draft of this in a long, long time. I'm realizing it's the kind
of thing that could form a good Youtube essay (I liked the [early history of Yu-Gi-Oh]
video a lot), but, that is not my skill set and I'm not interested in making
longform video content.

**Post about Dustforce:**

Odds of writing this year: 20%  
Odds of writing eventually: 60%

Okay, I have also been playing Dustforce less, but this isn't because I've found
the game less fun. It's because my laptop's keyboard started developing ghosting
issues that randomly eat my jump and attack inputs. This laptop's getting old enough
that I need to replace it, but I still think this game is criminally underrated.
