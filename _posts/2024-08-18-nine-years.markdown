*Sorta Insightful* turns nine years old today!

# Highlights

I was expecting to have more free time for writing this year. I did have more
free time, but I ended up spending it on other things.

The main reason I've had more free time is that I stopped writing puzzles.
Puzzle writing has been one of my main recent hobbies, but I've found the problem
is that I can't do low key puzzlehunt writing. I either go all-in or I don't,
and when I go all-in, it takes up enough headspace that I struggle to do other
things. This year was a year I needed to do other things.

And I did do other things! There are some silent migrations I did in the background
(both Google Analytics and my time tracker got deprecated this year), but the most
notable new thing is that I switched career trajectories. We'll see how that
plays out.

Overall though, these decisions did not take as much time as puzzlehunting did,
and instead of writing...I mostly played games. Incremental games were a mistake,
do not recommend. If you're unfamiliar with the genre, *Cookie Clicker* is the
prototypical example. You start with a small number of resources, then achieve
exponentially larger resources through increasingly complicated progression systems.

I'm done with writing MIT Mystery Hunt! Freedom!

The [post]({% post_url 2023-04-21-mh-2023 %}) about it was pretty rewarding
to write, although "post" may be the wrong word. Credit to CJ for noting that the post
was long enough to pass [NaNoWriMo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Novel_Writing_Month).

Did it need to be that long? Eh, probably not, but I kept having ideas I wanted to put in.
I also knew I was not in a mood to revise
it to be shorter. The revisions I did were focused on grammar, word choice,
and overall flow, rather than deciding if an idea should be cut. (Feel free to
draw a comparison to the Hunt itself if you want.)

To be honest, I do not expect to write a post of that length again. I started
working on that post right after Mystery Hunt 2023 finished, and hardcore
focused on getting it out ASAP. "As soon as possible" turned out to be 3 months,
ending right when planning for [ABCDE:FG](https://archives.mitmh2023.com/2023/abcde.puzzlefactory.place/about) ramped up. The end result was that I was
exerting "write Mystery Hunt" levels of effort (10-20 hrs/week) for 1.5 years
straight. That was just too much, and I burned out on doing anything with my
free time besides vegetating.

My burnout lined up almost
*exactly* with getting a copy of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.
Let's say my escapism into TotK was especially therapeutic. I'm done with the
game now, and am still adjusting to not having a "default" action taking up
mindshare.
"I should write a puzzle", "I should write about writing puzzles", or
"I should go find more Koroks" have been like, the only three thoughts I've had outside
of work since last year. Gotta have more thoughts than those!

# Statistics

## Posts

I wrote 6 posts this year, down from 7 last year. In my defense, this is
a bit misleading, especially if I pull up the time stats.

## Time Spent

I spent **189 hours, 45 minutes** writing for my blog this year, around 1.9x as
long as last year.

Around 170 hours of that was on the [Mystery Hunt retrospective]({% post_url 2023-04-21-mh-2023 %}) post.

# Posts in Limbo

**Post about Dominion Online:**

Odds of writing this year: 5%  
Odds of writing eventually: 25%

My priorities are moving away from Dominion. This may be the first year I skip the yearly championship, I'm not too interested in grinding my skill level back up. Still, I can't let go of writing this eventually.

**Post about Dustforce:**

Odds of writing this year: 20%  
Odds of writing eventually: 60%

I still think Dustforce is one of the best platformers of all time. I've been playing a
lot more Celeste recently thanks to [Strawberry Jam](https://gamebanana.com/mods/424541),
but Dustforce still does some things that no one else has replicated in a satisfying way.

**Post about puzzlehunting 201:**

Odds of writing this year: 50%  
Odds of writing eventually: 90%

This is a post I've been considering for a while. There are [introduction to puzzlehunt](https://blog.vero.site/post/puzzlehunts) posts, a so-called "puzzlehunt 101", but there is no
"puzzlehunting 201" for people familiar with the basics and interested in solving faster.
I was going to write this last year,
embedding puzzle content in it for Mystery Hunt, but didn't have a solid puzzle idea
and got too busy. Now I'm less busy.

**Post about AI timelines:**

Odds of writing this year: 90%  
Odds of writing eventually: 99%

I'm not planning a big update to the last timelines [post]({% post_url 2020-08-18-ai-timelines %}). I just think it's time to review what I wrote last time, given that it's been 3 years.
(And selfishly, because I think I called a lot of things correctly and want to
brag about that.)
