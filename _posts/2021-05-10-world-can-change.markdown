A few years ago, a friend asked me what I expected to happen in the next 10 years,
and when I made my best guess, he said it didn't sound like I was a part of the
storyline.

I think this is something I'm still working through. A lot of my life has revolved
around two general principles.

1. Understand the rules of the system around me.
2. Figure out how to achieve my goals based on those rules.

It's part of why I like video
games. Usually, these games are built to slowly teach you their rules, then give
you challenges based on applying what you've learned, whether you realize the game
was teaching you or not.

But games aren't reality. They're games. The thing with video games is that their
rules can't be broken. It's the same programming, the same source code. Maybe there
are exploits *within* that code, but it's still the same substrate. The systems are
God and what happens happens.

The part I'm working on, is understanding when I'm treating something like an
unviolatable rule, even when it isn't.

Well, maybe that's not the way to put it.

When I consider the world around me, I tend to mentally bucket them into two
categories: things I can change, and things I can't. I split the world, push
the "can't control" bucket out of mind, and just think about the things I can
control. And for much of my life, I've treated "things I can change" as things I
could personally do. Cleaning up my own desk, taking better notes, trying
better sleep schedules, and so on. There was me and the world, and once I
understood the world enough, I'd accept it and keep going, whether or not the
world's rules were fair or made sense.

That's not how the world has to work! Some people look at the world, figure out its
rules, say "these rules are GARBAGE", and then spend their time trying to change
the world until its rules work the way they want them to.

It's the difference between someone who goes to an office job because their
passion doesn't pay the bills, and someone who decides that they're going to spend
their time convincing people their passion *is* worth money, so that they can do
their passion instead.

It's the difference between a one-issue voter who votes for the candidate that seems
closest every 2 years, and a one-issue voter who decides to start a movement to make
their one issue big enough that candidates *have* to care about it.

It takes a different kind of mindset to believe - *genuinely believe* - that you
can become the President of the United States, earn a billion dollars, or remake
the world's transportation infrastructure, to name a few lofty goals. None of these
feel like things you can achieve by taking the world as it comes to you. It's more like
dragging the world along until it organizes itself in a way where you *have* to be President
or *have* to be a billionaire for the world to make sense.

The dark side of this mindset is that I think it is *super super easy* to become an
asshole completely untethered from reality. You can tell people they're dumb if they don't
believe in your vision. That doesn't mean you're right.
You can try to change everything. That
doesn't mean you'll actually succeed. And surrounding yourself with people who will
only tell you you'll succeed, sounds like one of the surest ways to guarantee you won't.
