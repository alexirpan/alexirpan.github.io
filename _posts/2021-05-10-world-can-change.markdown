Once, a friend asked me what I expected to happen in the next 10 years.
When I made my best guess, he observed that it sounded like I was narrating the
work of other people, rather than placing myself in the narrative.

I'd say this is one of the main mental blocks I've been working through.

Normally, I mentally bucket everything into two categories: things I can change,
and things I can't. If I can't change something then it's not worth thinking
about it, so I push it out of my mind. Then I just focus on the things that are
under my control and do the best I can.

And I mean, this isn't an awful strategy. It works fantastically for video games,
because in most games you can't change how they work. It's fixed programming with
the same source code, and although there might be exploits *within* that code,
you can't change the code itself. The systems of the game are God, and what
happens happens. It's good to understand how those systems work, but it's useless
to try to change them. You're better off finding another game if you have
disagreements with a game's systems.

In the real world, the systems are *not* God.
They could be fair or cruel, well-reasoned or nonsensical, but they aren't static.
We made them, and we can change them too. Sometimes I forget that.

I think some people don't have this issue. They have some base level of arrogance that
if the world doesn't work the way they think it should, then they'll spend their
time trying to change the world until it aligns with their expectations.

Here is an example: suppose there's a person that only cares about squirrels. They
think they're super neat, and want more! They want squirrels
*everywhere*.

Most people do not care about squirrels. The world is not set up to reward squirrel
enthusiasm. And they could accept this and just go on their merry way, and honestly,
their life will probably be just fine. Alternatively, they could
Another option is that they write essays and give speeches and cold-email environmentalists
explaining why squirrels are excellent. This will probably piss off a bunch of people
who don't want to listen to Yet Another Squirrel Stump Speech, but it'll drum up
support too. Maybe their dreams of a squirrel-filled world will come true. Maybe they
won't. But no one can say they didn't try to make the world care more about
squirrels.

Yes, okay, this is a silly example. However, to me the broad strokes describe pretty
much every succesful political movement. They're all campaigns to shift public opinion
in your preferred direction.

Basically, if the status quo sucks, you don't have to just complain about it
with your friends. I mean, you should *totally* still complain about it. Complaining
is fun. But you can (and should) also take agency to fix it. My guess is that most
people reading this have more power than they realize.
