title:  "The 5 Year Update on Skipping Grad School"

In the fall semester of 2015, I was in my last year of undegrad and had a
lot of angst about whether I should apply to PhD programs, whether I wanted to
do a PhD at all, or if I just wanted to go work in industry or do something
completely different. I ended up choosing to go to industry,
writing a [6000 word blog post]({% post_url 2016-01-03-grad-school %}) about why
I did so after the fact.

I wrote that post to try to express the stress and thoughts I had before making
that decision, for myself if not for anyone else. It resonated with a few
people and I'm happy that it did. Now it's 2021, about 5 years since that
decision, and given that the average computer science PhD is 5 years long,
I thought it'd be interesting to see where I ended up.

If you don't know me, I went to UC Berkeley for undergrad, did some research
(mostly in reinforcement learning), then joined Google Brain through their
AI residency program. I did that for a year, then stayed there ever since,
and now I work on the Robotics team. I still do ML research, primarily on
applying imitation learning and reinforcement learning to robot manipulation
problems.


Interest

This is a quote from the Ph.D. Grind, which I agreed with pretty strongly.
Learning about new research is awesome, in the same way that taking classes
is awesome, because someone has taken care to deliver a packet of knowledge
as quickly and clearly as possible into your head.

Reality is unfortunately not set up to give you insights at every step,
and since research is about understanding reality, it's much more time
consuming and draining to learn something new. I think in 2016 I 100% agree
with this quote, but now I would amend it to,

> The burden of being a continual producer of new research is too great
> without careful management.

In hindsight, my biggest shift is getting better at work-life balance. I think
I got more done in university, but it wasn't sustainable for my mental health.
There's a sweet spot where I feel like I can make research progress without
burning out, and in that sweet spot research is great.

Now, I'm pretty sure I'm not at my max potential, and I could be doing a lot
more if I worked more. I just choose not to because life is more fun that way.

Another big factor was that I didn't make much progress on any of my undergrad
progress, and that left me very uncertain about whether I wanted to keep
going.

I've since been a part of some noteworthy papers, and that's helped things too - knowing
that I've contributed to real changes in the research landscape makes it easier
to keep going.

I'm guessing my interest is higher than it would have been if I went to grad school.
The papers that made a big splash are ones with 10+ authors that don't tend to
come out of academic labs. In a PhD setting I would have probably worked on more
papers that each made a smaller impact and that would have been less fulfilling.
I also might have kept up the same habits as undergrad, which would have kept me
burnt out.


Confidence
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Another reason I didn't apply to PhD programs was that I wasn't sure
I was in the same weight class for research ability as my peers. My research was
nowhere near good enough to publish, meetings felt like I was desperately
trying not to drown in new topics and iedas, and it was all just a bit much.
Friends in my year said they thought I'd do well in grad school. I disagreed.

In hindsight....well, they weren't wrong. I'm not sure if they were *right*. I've done
okay in industy research, but working in an industry research lab is different from
grad school.
Working
in an industry research lab is different from grad school. But if I had gone to
grad school, I think I could have held my own. It's surprising how much easier it
got after bashing through the first few walls.

Let's call this a wash. My research self-confidence was at a near bottom in
undergrad and it would have improved regardless of where I went.


Social Life
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is pretty clearly worse. I'm more towards the introverted side and didn't
talk to a lot of people growing up. I'm not depressed or unhappy by any means.
Through practice, I've developed a long, winding maze of entertainment and side projects
that keep me busy if I don't have the energy for socializing. The problem is that the maze
is too efficient, sometimes it takes a long time to get out, and when I do I usually
wish I socialized more.

University life shakes that maze in a way that working life doesn't.
When everyone lives near campus, everyone goes to campus for whatever event's happening,
and you can serendipitously run into friends in the street, it's just a lot easier to meet people
and hang out.

This happens in industry too (there's a reason water cooler chat is a thing), it's just not
to the same degree. Also, the demographics are different. I just find it easier to hang out
with people in the same age bracket and it's a lot more diverse outside of PhD programs.


Reputation
----------------------------------------------------------------------

By reputation, I roughly mean this: how often are you asked to review for a conference or
journal? Are you asked to area chair? If you went to give a talk somewhere, what fraction
of people would go because of your name, rather than the subject of your talk?

I find it all kinda grimey to think about, but it does matter, especially for research.
Getting a PhD is tough and painful, but publishing papers and getting that stamp of approval
is the most durable form of reputation if you want to keep doing research. Right now, the
demand for ML / AI talent is still way bigger than the supply of PhDs, so companies will
take people who don't have PhDs, but this may not last forever. (Ask people in
electrical engineering.) If you're confident you want to keep doing research, getting a PhD
is the safest option. This is the consistent advice everyone I know has gotten.

When I got the AI residency offer, I treated it as a 1 year pause while I figured out if
I wanted to keep doing research or not.
