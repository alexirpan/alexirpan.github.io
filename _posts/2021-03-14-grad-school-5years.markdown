title:  "The 5 Year Update on Skipping Grad School (and Whether I'd Recommend It)"
date:   2021-03-14 02:20:00 -0700
---

In the fall semester of 2015, I was in my last year of undergrad and had a
lot of angst about whether I should apply to PhD programs.
I ended up not applying,
writing a [6000 word blog post]({% post_url 2016-01-03-grad-school %})
explaining why. The short version is: lots of imposter syndrome, disillusionment
about whether I could handle the marathon of research, wavering faith in
doing research at all, and an eventual decision that if I wasn't sure about research,
I couldn't turn down the money and steady work that industry offered.

That post wasn't really meant to be educational. It was more an expression of
my stress and feelings, written for myself rather than anyone else. But I know
it resonated with a few people, and I'm happy it did.

After that, I interviewed around, got an AI residency offer from Google Research,
and did that for a year. I then stayed there full-time and
now work on the Robotics team, as a research engineer. I primarily work on
applying imitation learning and reinforcement learning to robot manipulation
problems.

It's been 5 years since I
decided not to apply to a PhD program, and 5-6 years is about the length of
a computer science PhD. There's a nice parallel there, so I figured I'd write an
update on how things have gone, in case people in a similar position find it useful.


Disclaimers
---------------------------------------------------------------------

* This is based off what I believe grad school is like,
but my model could be incorrect.
* Industry research labs are not identical and my experience may not be typical.
* This is specific to machine learning PhDs. ML is in a very unique position
that doesn't generalize to other fields. Extrapolate with caution.
* 2015-2016 was a crazy year for
deep learning. AlphaGo had just won against Lee Sedol, OpenAI was founded, and companies were
going crazy on hiring. I personally think I was very lucky to get the offer I did -
Google had never done an AI residency before so it was less competitive. I'm not sure
I would have gotten in if I applied 1 year later, and things would be very different if
I had done a generic SWE job instead.


Desire to do a PhD
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The common wisdom is that you can jump back to a PhD after 1 year in industry,
and it gets exponentially less likely after that.

This is definitely true, but it's not because your research skills decay that quickly. It's
that bandwagon effects are real. You're going from an environment where many people
are considering PhD programs, to one where most people have no plans to
go back to school. You need to be a much weirder person to decide to do a PhD
once you've settled into a work routine.
I'm not that weird of a person. Well, I mean, I am weird. Just
not weird in that way.

Additionally, professor recommendations are a large part of PhD applications.
Your research skills may not decay that quickly, but your professor's memory of
those skills might. For that reason, it's better to apply first and defer the offers
you get if you want to keep your options open.

Right now, I feel I can achieve my goals without going back
to get a PhD, and although formally having the degree would be nice, I don't
want the diploma. I want what the diploma represents, and there are ways to
get it outside grad school.


Research Confidence
----------------------------------------------------------------------

One reason I didn't apply to PhD programs was that I wasn't sure
I was in the same weight class of research ability as my peers. My undergrad
research was never good enough to publish.
Meetings felt like I was desperately
trying not to drown in new topics. It was all a bit much.
When I talked to friends in my year, they reassured me and said I'd do well in grad school.
I disagreed.

In hindsight...I'm not sure if they were *right*, but they weren't wrong. I'm
more calibrated on my abilities now and think I definitely could have kept up,
albeit not superstar tier.

I think the reason I underestimated my ability is that getting through the first
few walls is the hardest. It's surprising how much easier research got after that.
It's still hard, but I have a better handle on how projects organize themselves
(as well as how they fall apart, which is an unfortunate but inevitable lesson).

When I imagine the world where I did a PhD instead, it feels like a wash.
My research self-confidence was at a near bottom in
undergrad and it would have improved regardless of where I went. I was getting
better, I just didn't realize it yet.


Research Interest
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

> I discovered over the past 5 years that I love being a spectator of
> research, but the burden of being a continual producer of new research is
> just too great for me.

This is a quote from the Ph.D. Grind, and 2015-me agreed with this as-is.
Learning about new research is awesome, in the same way that taking classes
is awesome, because the paper authors / teachers have thought about how to
deliver knowledge as quickly and clearly as possible into your head.
If the paper's confusing, or the course doesn't cover the right topics,
they've failed.

Reality is unfortunately not set up this way,
and since research is about understanding reality, it's much more time
consuming and draining to learn something new. In exchange, the a-has can
be much more satisfying.

I would now amend the quote above to:

> The burden of being a continual producer of new research is too great
> without careful management.

I got much better at work-life balance once I left university. This is
definitely at the cost of my productivity. I got more done in school, but
it wasn't sustainable for my mental health.
There's a sweet spot where I feel I can do research without
burning out, and in that sweet spot research is great.

In short, I could be doing more, and I
choose not to because I have other priorities and life is more fun that way.

It's intertwined with the Research Confidence section, but another reason I
was disinterested in research was that failing to make progress in undergrad
made me very pessimistic I would do anything meaningful in research.

(notes to myself from 2015)
{: .centered }

I've since been part of some noteworthy papers like [QT-Opt](https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/06/scalable-deep-reinforcement-learning.html) and
[GraspGAN](https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/10/closing-simulation-to-reality-gap-for.html),
and that's helped me believe in myself.
When I got my first email asking for help reproducing a paper, I was pretty excited - they
wouldn't be asking unless they were paying attention!
Seeing that concrete thread of influence between
my work and changes in the research landscape makes it easier to keep going.

I'm guessing my interest is higher than it would have been if I went to grad school.
The papers I was on that made a big splash were from large projects with 10+ authors. Those
don't tend to come out of academic ML labs. In a PhD setting, I likely would have worked on more
papers that each had smaller impact, and that would have been less fulfilling.


Money and Freedom
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Money isn't my first priority, but I'm not going to ignore it.

If you only care about the money, doing an ML PhD just doesn't
make sense.
Unless you discover something [revolutionary that starts a bidding war](https://www.wired.com/story/secret-auction-race-ai-supremacy-google-microsoft-baidu/),
5-6 years of ML engineer / data scientist salary + compounding returns from investing that
in index funds will get you more than most post-PhD jobs.

You don't do a PhD for the money, but money tends to correlate with freedom. One of the reasons
people apply to PhD programs is to get the freedom to research what they find interesting and
important.
On that front, friends in academia have told me *very* mixed things. Some told me they felt they
could do anything, while others told me about labmates who
had to teach courses they didn't want to teach or do part-time work outside of grad school to pay the bills.

The common thread I've heard is that PhD students should try to get as much unconditional
funding as possible. Usually, this means fellowships from NSF or other places. Having your
advisor as your sole source of funding is a risk, because that money comes from grants,
which are tied to proposals, and there's a chance you'll need to do work that matches the
proposal rather than the research you're supposed to be doing. A good advisor tries to shield
their grad students from this by getting uncondtional grants, but it depends on the professor.
Having more unconditional grants can help you get out of bad situations.

In contrast, industry labs have one source of funding (the company), and it'll pay enough that you
won't need to think about side hustles. You will probably get to focus on research more, but you
won't have radical freedom. I remember a dinner at NeurIPS, where a professor said that sometimes
the best thing for a grad student is to have them go read textbooks for 9 months to learn all the
math foundation they need for their research interests. This is the sort of thing you can do
in academia, that you can't really do in industry.

It's also possible that your company will lay-off your
research lab without much recourse. To give recent examples,
in 2014 Microsoft closed their entire Silicon Valley research lab. In 2020, UberAI downsized and Alphabet
shut down Loon.

The freedom in an industry lab isn't obviously worse than a PhD. A person with stable funding in an
industry lab likely has more research freedom and time than a PhD student with unstable funding.
On average though, I'd say that PhD programs have the edge.


Social Life
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm more of an introvert, and didn't
talk to a lot of people growing up. I'm not depressed or unhappy by any means.
Through practice, I've developed a long, winding maze of entertainment and side projects
that keep me busy if I don't have the energy to catch up with friends. The problem is that the maze
is too effective, sometimes it takes a long time to get out, and when I do I usually
wish I had exited the maze sooner and socialized more.

Undergrad life shook that maze in a way that working life didn't.
When everyone lives near campus, everyone goes to campus whenever an event's happening,
and you can serendipitously run into friends in the street, it's just a lot easier to meet people
and hang out.

Those things happen in industry too (there's a reason water cooler chat is a thing), it just doesn't
happen to the same degree. The demographics are also different. I find it harder to relate when
people talk about their kids, or buying a new house.

Based on talking to friends, everyone socializes less after undergrad. If you go into industry, you'll mostly
see people on your team.If you go to grad school, you'll take fewer classes and mostly be spending
time in your lab. In both cases you get fewer chances to meet new people. I think the largest
factor is going to be whether you live in a city, or near people who like to host events, and
industry vs grad school is secondary.


Research Reputation
----------------------------------------------------------------------

By reputation, I mean: how often are you asked to review for a conference or
journal? Are you asked to area chair for reviewing? If you went to give a talk somewhere, how
much of the interest would be driven by your name, rather than the subject of your talk?
People usually call this "status". I'm using reputation because it's alliterative.

I find it all kinda grimey to think about, but it does matter, especially for research.
Reputation matters because it's the way you stay employed. If you want to keep doing research,
you need to both be good at research, and be known as someone who's good at research.
Right now, the
demand for ML / AI talent is still way bigger than the supply of PhDs, so companies will
take anyone they think can do the work. This may not last forever. Ask people in electrical
engineering - I've heard EE companies used to hire anyone they could find, and now
it's hard to get anywhere without at least a master's. To quote John Langford at
the Real World Reinforcement Learning workshop, ["if there is one piece of machine
learning that's going to crash, it's going to be reinforcement learning"](https://slideslive.com/38917654/a-real-world-reinforcement-learning-revolution).
Unfortunate for me, given what problems I find interesting!

There's two kinds of research reputation: word of mouth, and influence through publications. Word of mouth
is easier to get. You can give a good talk, make an impression on someone when
you mingle at a conference, or contribute useful ideas during a research brainstorm within your lab.
But word of mouth isn't permanent. It's tied to the people you work with and the institution you
work at. People change jobs, fortunes turn, and if everyone who knows you leaves, then you're
left with nothing.

Word of mouth *can* be very useful, if you have it from the right person. If a well-known
professor is willing to vouch for you, that means a lot, because they've seen many prospective
students, are calibrated on what a good researcher looks like, and it's common knowledge that
they're calibrated. That means they can make pretty strong cases in your favor if they think you
deserve them, and is why recommendations are important when applying for PhD programs. A
recommendation from an industry lab higher-up can be good for similar reasons.

Outside of these cases, most recommendations don't mean much. Being known as "the dude who
knows X well" is nice, but word alone is not enough, because lots of people "know a guy",
that recommendation only means something if the person hiring you knows how calibrated the
recommender is, and they only know the calibration if the recommender is pretty well-known.
Word of mouth has a short reach.

If you're confident you want to keep doing research for the rest of your life, you want to have
concrete, visible proof of your skills. For research, that means publishing. h-index isn't
a prefect metric, but people do care about it when hiring. Getting a higher h-index requires
having lots of papers, snd getting a PhD is a surefire way to force you to publish.
It'll be tough and painful, and
your papers may not be the best, but they'll be out there, and once the papers are out there,
no one can take them away from you.

When I got the AI residency offer, I treated it as a 1 year trial run of whether I wanted
to keep doing research. After that year, I decided that yeah, this was still cool, and went for a
riskier plan: get enough publications out of my industry research to create a PhD-equivalent
body of work, such that no one would care I didn't formally have a PhD. This wouldn't
qualify me for any faculty positions, but I was okay with that.

That hasn't gone as planned. I've been on some papers, but not that many.
I've reviewed for conferences, but I get the feeling that the reviewer pool is so
starved that organizers are asking anyone they can get to review for them. Working on big projects
is good for driving the field, but the papers that come out of them are often treated as "the Apple
paper" or "the Uber paper", rather than "the paper by X & Y".
Funnily enough,
this blog is probably the biggest reputation boost I have. My [post about deep RL]({% post_url 2018-02-14-rl-hard %}) is still my most viewed post,
and I'd like to think it helps get my foot in the door. In the end, what matters is influence
on the research community, which is tied to citations but also acheivable via other means.

My reputation would have probably been equal if I
had gone to a PhD program, because I would have written for this blog either way, and evidently
it's the main reason people know who I am. My takeaway is that more people should
start blogs! I don't know why they don't.
Maybe they're
too busy writing papers or something 😛. Jokes on
them, I get to use emojis and they don't. If I didn't have this blog, my reputation would probably be a bit better
in a PhD program.


Research Ability
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the hardest for me to judge.

Getting a PhD isn't about getting a lot of publications. It's about learning how to form and
attack a long term research thesis, with publications as a natural byproduct. To borrow
fighting game advice, practice isn't about winning, it's about learning something, and you'll
win more if you do so.

A good advisor will help you figure out what problem you should try tackling next, explain
why that decision makes sense, and repeat this process until you figure out how to do it
yourself. This is what people mean when they say you'll develop research taste.
If a professor doesn't do this, then they aren't a good advisor,
and professors want to be good advisors. It's how they get *their* reputation. Yes,
professors want grad students to try ideas that they don't have time for, but eventually
those students will set out on their own.

No one is required to give you this mentorship in an industry lab. The more top-down the
lab, the truer this is. Industry labs tend organize themselves around a grand vision, like
"we can build a quantum computer", or "all AI needs is good scaling", and although these
are very broad theses, more of the research direction is already sketched out by the
team lead.
That leaves less research direction for you to figure out.

On the other hand, it's possible your advisor in a PhD program doesn't mentor
you either! Based on talking to research scientists at Brain, a surprising number have said
their professors were too busy to help them much, compared to their labmates. And
if you're stuck figuring it out with your labmates, then your labmates in
an industry lab will include people who've finished a PhD. Fewer people are *obligated* to
give you mentorship, but more people *could* give you mentorship.

If you figure out whether your boss / advisor will be good before making
a decision, that solves everything, but doing so is easier said than done.
Everyone I know who's left Google did so because
they didn't get along with their manager, and to me it feels like a cosmic roll of the dice
whether that happens or not. Getting a good advisor is a similar roll, except with higher stakes
- a PhD advisor has more power than a manager does.

I think the grad student $$\rightarrow$$ advisor relationship can be felt out more if you
make good use of visit days. The trick is to ask the PhD students, rather than the professor.
So you do have slightly better odds. That level of access is harder to get when considering
industry offers, unless you're good at being persistent with recruiters.

I got lucky and had mentors in industry who encouraged me to consider
where the field was going. I think on expectation, my research ability would be about the same if I
was in a PhD program, but there would be high variance on how it could've played out.


Research Direction
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I started undergrad planning to double major in math and CS, and like theoretical CS in general.
If I had gone to a PhD program, there's a real chance I would have ended up in learning theory
instead of robot learning.

Many industry labs have good theory people, but on average an industry lab will be more experimental.
The argument is, industry labs have access to bigger computing clusters, therefore it's more
scientifically interesting if industry labs work on projects that exploit the comparative advantage
of more compute, because
this produces research of a different flavor. (I would link a post that argues this with examples,
but it was hosted on Google+.)

I find this argument very reasonable, but it puts pressure on theoretical work. Why is the industry
lab paying you, when they could be letting you do that work in academia? All you need is your brain.

From what I've seen, theory work from industry
labs is usually a hybrid of new theory, along with experiments showing that it works. Otherwise,
pure theory work is rare, unless there is a high certainty path between that theory and something
revenue generating. In those scenarios, it's important for the company to hire theory people to
stay on the cutting edge.

I would probably be doing more theory if I had gone to a PhD program. My research interests
aren't perfectly aligned with my day-to-day work, but they're reasonably aligned and I'm willing to
take the trade-offs it comes with. The good part of robot learning is that getting things to work
in the real world makes you directly hit hard, interesting problems that have to be solved for ML research to be
useful. The bad part is that you have to deal with the real world.

Figuring out a research direction is one of the most helpful deciding factors when choosing
between industry and research. The subfield you pick affects the number of job openings industry
will have for you. If you want to work in a less popular subfield, academia may be your only option.
It's up to you how much you're willing to bend.


Type of Work Done
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In a PhD program, if there's non-research work that needs to be done, like fixing your NumPy
installation, you'll usually do it yourself.

In an industry lab, if there's non-research work that needs to be done, like fixing your NumPy
installation...you'll also usually do it yourself.

When I talk to people considering skipping a PhD, a common worry they have is that if they join
an industry research lab, they'll be expected to do more software engineering work and less research.
The first piece of advice I'd give is that even if you have a PhD, you'll probably do grunt SWE work.
Research tools will always feel deficient, because your research will
uncover new problems, and it's unlikely the perfect tool exists for a problem no one but you has
seen before. A PhD will not save you - you will be debugging garbage your entire life.

The second piece of advice is that I think getting boxed into non-research work is a real, valid
concern. Unfortunately, every industry lab is different, so I don't have much advice besides
asking friends who work in those labs, if you know any. In my experience, if you like a project,
you won't mind the grunt work as much, so I'd optimize for that first.

Coming in through the AI residency program meant I did research from day 1, and by the end of that
year I had convinced enough people to keep getting central roles in future research projects.
However, I've also done a lot of SWE work for each project, because they usually involved
large distributed systems that were tricky to understand, build, and debug. I think my day-to-day
work would have been similar in academia, I'd just be debugging different kinds of distributed
systems.


Skills Learned
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In an industry lab, you'll learn software engineering best practices. Or rather, you'll be
forced to do code reviews, write unit tests, etc., because otherwise your code isn't getting
checked into the repository.

Most PhD programs don't do this. I understand why, but...okay, I'm going to rant for a bit.
Pardon the side track.

Research code is, as a rule, not very good. I used to think this was fine and even
desirable. I no longer think this is true.

There is this longstanding idea that research code is bad because researchers don't know if
their ideas will work. If the idea doesn't work out, then time spent cleaning up the
implementation is wasted, compared to spending the time on new ideas. I 100% agree with
this, all the very good researchers I know try lots of ideas. (Pure volume isn't enough,
they try their ideas with purpose, but they try a lot of ideas with purpose.)

My issue is that people take this too far. Look, writing beautiful code takes time. Writing
*legible* code does not take much more time. Using real variable names and adding useful
comments
reduces the complexity of the mental model of your code, which makes it easier to catch bugs.
This is especially important in machine learning, where bugs don't surface as compiler
errors, they surface as 20% drops in performance. Since that performance drop could come
from bugs, or bad data, or a bad model, you want to make sure that bugs are easy to quickly disprove. *Doing
some code cleanup  will save time in the long run, even if you're the only one who looks at your research code,* and if you
ever work with collaborators, they'll thank you. This is especially true if your
collaborator is future-you trying to run an experiment for a reviewer rebuttal 2 months after you've
touched any of the relevant code.

You'll get better at coding in an industry lab, and this will make you a better researcher.
It's an osmosis thing - even if no one teaches you good habits, you're
embedded in a company with non-researcher SWEs and will naturally acquire good habits.

Now on the flip side, you're not going to teach many classes in industry. Depending on the
company, you may have the chance to teach some, but you'll have many more chances in academia.
And teaching will also make you a better researcher, because it will force you to clarify
ideas until newcomers can understand them, which is the exact skill you need when writing papers.

Academia will also provide more mentorship opportunities. In academia, the totem pole
is professor > postdoc > grad student > undergrad. Going to a PhD program means you aren't on the
bottom anymore, and you'll get to mentor undergrads that are looking to get into research.
Whereas in industry, if you join out of undergrad, you're entering at the bottom of the totem
pole and will have fewer mentoring opportunities until interns come, which is a seasonal
thing. If you really value research mentorship, you probably want a faculty position, in which
case you should go for a PhD.

Personally, I believe in all of coding, teaching, and mentorship, but right now my time is
more weighted to coding + teaching, where teaching means writing blog posts.
In a PhD program, it'd likely be weighted towards teaching +
mentorship, where teaching means TAing a class. And then the research skills learned would be
similar between the two.


Conclusion
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I don't have regrets about my decision. Given what I knew about myself at the time, it was the
right choice.

I also don't have any plans to go back to academia. I'm not saying it'll never happen, but it would
take something seismic for me to change my mind.

The standard advice for students near the end of undergrad is that they should mentally downweigh their enthusiasm
for grad school: if you're very excited about grad school, you should only be moderately excited,
and if you're unsure about it, then you shouldn't go. I still agree with this, but I probably would have
gotten *more* enthusiastic about research if I had gone to grad school. **This is not normal.**
Even if I think doing a PhD would have worked out for me, I would never recommend using a PhD to figure
out your life.

If you can get an offer out of undergrad for a good industry lab, and know you'll get a chance
to publish, it's a compelling offer and I would take it seriously.
