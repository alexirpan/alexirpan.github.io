title:  "The 5 Year Update on Skipping Grad School"

In the fall semester of 2015, I was in my last year of undegrad and had a
lot of angst about whether I should apply to PhD programs, whether I wanted to
do a PhD at all, or if I just wanted to go work in industry or do something
completely different. I ended up choosing to go to industry,
writing a [6000 word blog post]({% post_url 2016-01-03-grad-school %}) about why
I did so after the fact.

I wrote that post to try to express the stress and thoughts I had before making
that decision, for myself if not for anyone else. It resonated with a few
people and I'm happy that it did.

Since then, I joined the Brain team at Google Research through their AI
residency program. I did that for a year, then stayed there since. I
now work on the Robotics team, and still do ML research, primarily on
applying imitation learning and reinforcement learning to robot manipulation
problems.

As such, we've got an interesting counterfactual. It's been 5 years since I
decided not to apply to a PhD program, and 5 years is the average length of
a computer science PhD. So how have things differed?


Research Interest
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a quote from the Ph.D. Grind, which I agreed with pretty strongly.
Learning about new research is awesome, in the same way that taking classes
is awesome, because someone has taken care to deliver a packet of knowledge
as quickly and clearly as possible into your head.

Reality is unfortunately not set up to give you insights at every step,
and since research is about understanding reality, it's much more time
consuming and draining to learn something new. I think in 2016 I 100% agree
with this quote, but now I would amend it to,

> The burden of being a continual producer of new research is too great
> without careful management.

In hindsight, my biggest shift is getting better at work-life balance. I think
I got more done in university, but it wasn't sustainable for my mental health.
There's a sweet spot where I feel like I can make research progress without
burning out, and in that sweet spot research is great.

Now, I'm pretty sure I'm not at my max potential, and I could be doing a lot
more if I worked more. I just choose not to because life is more fun that way.

Another big factor was that I didn't make much progress on any of my undergrad
progress, and that left me very uncertain about whether I wanted to keep
going.

I've since been a part of some noteworthy papers, and that's helped things too - knowing
that I've contributed to real changes in the research landscape makes it easier
to keep going.

I'm guessing my interest is higher than it would have been if I went to grad school.
The papers that made a big splash are ones with 10+ authors that don't tend to
come out of academic labs. In a PhD setting I would have probably worked on more
papers that each made a smaller impact and that would have been less fulfilling.
I also might have kept up the same habits as undergrad, which would have kept me
burnt out.


Confidence
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Another reason I didn't apply to PhD programs was that I wasn't sure
I was in the same weight class for research ability as my peers. My research was
nowhere near good enough to publish, meetings felt like I was desperately
trying not to drown in new topics and iedas, and it was all just a bit much.
Friends in my year said they thought I'd do well in grad school. I disagreed.

In hindsight....well, they weren't wrong. I'm not sure if they were *right*. I've done
okay in industy research, but working in an industry research lab is different from
grad school.
Working
in an industry research lab is different from grad school. But if I had gone to
grad school, I think I could have held my own. It's surprising how much easier it
got after bashing through the first few walls.

Let's call this a wash. My research self-confidence was at a near bottom in
undergrad and it would have improved regardless of where I went.


Social Life
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is pretty clearly worse. I'm more towards the introverted side and didn't
talk to a lot of people growing up. I'm not depressed or unhappy by any means.
Through practice, I've developed a long, winding maze of entertainment and side projects
that keep me busy if I don't have the energy for socializing. The problem is that the maze
is too efficient, sometimes it takes a long time to get out, and when I do I usually
wish I socialized more.

University life shakes that maze in a way that working life doesn't.
When everyone lives near campus, everyone goes to campus for whatever event's happening,
and you can serendipitously run into friends in the street, it's just a lot easier to meet people
and hang out.

This happens in industry too (there's a reason water cooler chat is a thing), it's just not
to the same degree. Also, the demographics are different. I just find it easier to hang out
with people in the same age bracket and it's a lot more diverse outside of PhD programs.


Reputation
----------------------------------------------------------------------

By reputation, I roughly mean this: how often are you asked to review for a conference or
journal? Are you asked to area chair? If you went to give a talk somewhere, what fraction
of people would go because of your name, rather than the subject of your talk?

I find it all kinda grimey to think about, but it does matter, especially for research.
Getting a PhD is tough and painful, but publishing papers and getting that stamp of approval
is the most durable form of reputation if you want to keep doing research. Right now, the
demand for ML / AI talent is still way bigger than the supply of PhDs, so companies will
take people who don't have PhDs, but this may not last forever. (Ask people in
electrical engineering.) If you're confident you want to keep doing research, getting a PhD
is the safest option. This is the consistent advice everyone I know has gotten.

When I got the AI residency offer, I treated it as a 1 year trial run of whether I wanted
to keep doing research, and when I stayed on, I planned to get enough publications out to
make it such that no one would care that I didn't officially have a PhD.
That hasn't panned out the way I expected.

There's two kinds of research reputation: word of mouth, and publications. Word of mouth
is easier to get - you give a good talk, you make a good impression on someone when
you mingle at a conference, or you have fruitful discussions within your lab. But word
of mouth isn't permanant. It's tied to the institution, or the people you work
with most closely. People change jobs, fortunes turn - it's not a good foundation.

It certainly isn't worthless! But I believe you want publications and citations to be the
base of your reputation, because it's absolute and no one can take it away from you. And
you'll get more publications in a PhD program. Publish or perish, as they say.
They won't all be good papers, but they will be out there.

On that front, I haven't been on too many papers. I have been asked to review for conferences,
but I get the feeling that reviews are so starved that practically everyone in the research
community gets asked for those. Funnily enough, this blog is probably the biggest reputation
boost I have. More people should start blogs! I don't know why they don't. Maybe they're
too busy writing papers or something ðŸ˜›. Jokes on Tthem, I get to use emojis and they don't.


Ability
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the hardest to judge. I definitely got better at research but I really don't know
if I'd have gotten better faster in a PhD program or not.

Getting a PhD isn't about getting a lot of publications, it's about learning how to form and
attack a long term research thesis. Now, getting the publications is a necessary side effect
of that, but the aim of a good advisor is that they help you figure out what problem you
should try next, explain why that decision makes sense, and repeat until you figure out
how to do it yourself. If a professor doesn't do this, then they aren't a good advisor,
and professors want to be good advisors. It's how they get *their* own reputation.

No one is required to give you this kind of mentorship in an industry lab. (This is especially
true for labs that are more top-down in research direction, since the path will be paved
for you.)
On the other hand,
your peer group will have more people who *could* give you that mentorship. Basically,
if you're in a PhD program, you have your advisor and then a bunch of grad students trying
to figure it out themselves. If your advisor has time, they're great! If they don't, then
you might be stuck figuring it out your labmates. (The latter seems more common, based on
talking to research scientists at Brain...) If you're stuck figuring it out with your
labmates, then, well, in an industry lab some of your labmates will have finished their PhD
and been in the game for longer.

I got lucky and had mentors who encouraged me about research direction, so I think this
was about the same.

Conclusion
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I don't have regrets about my decision. Given what I knew about myself at the time, it was the
right choice.

I think the standard advice for rising undergrads is that they should mentally downweight your enthusiasm
for grad school: if you're very excited about grad school, you should only be moderately excited,
and if you're unsure about it, then you shouldn't go. This is definitely true in general, but
I would add a big addendum: **try getting a full-time research job during the summer.**
I chose not to do this, and in hindsight, juggling both research and course work was *very*
different from full-time research.

If you can get an offer out of undergrad for the top industry labs, and know you'll get a chance
to publish, it's a compelling offer and I would take it seriously. I personally think I was
very lucky to get the offer I did. 2015-2016 was a crazy year for deep learning. AlphaGo
had just won against Lee Sedol, OpenAI was founded, companies were going crazy on hiring,
and I had the right experience to capitalize on that.
