title:  "The 5 Year Update on Skipping Grad School (and Whether I'd Recommend It)"
date:   2021-03-14 02:20:00 -0700
---

In the fall semester of 2015, I was in my last year of undergrad and had a
lot of angst about whether I should apply to PhD programs, whether I wanted to
do a PhD at all, or if I was done with all of that.
I ended up choosing to not apply to PhD programs,
writing a [6000 word blog post]({% post_url 2016-01-03-grad-school %})
explaining why.

That post wasn't really meant to be educational...it was more an expression of
my stress and feelings, written for myself rather than anyone else. But I know
it resonated with a few people, and I'm happy it did.

After that, I joined the Brain team at Google Research through their AI
residency program, then stayed there ever since. I
now work on the Robotics team, and still do ML research, primarily on
applying imitation learning and reinforcement learning to robot manipulation
problems.

As such, we've got an interesting counterfactual. It's been 5 years since I
decided not to apply to a PhD program, and 5 years is the average length of
a computer science PhD. How might things have played out if I had done a PhD
instead?


Disclaimers
---------------------------------------------------------------------

* I did not do a PhD. This is based off what I believe grad school is like,
but my model could be incorrect.
* Industry research labs are not identical - my experience may not be typical.
* This is specific to machine learning PhDs. ML is in a very unique position
that doesn't generalize to other fields. Extrapolate with caution.


Desire to do a PhD
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The common wisdom is that you can jump back to a PhD after 1 year in industry,
and it gets exponentially less likely after that.

This is definitely true, but it's not because your resarch skills decay. It's
that bandwagon effects are real. You're going from an environment where many people
are considering PhD programs, to one where most people people have no plans to
go back to school. You need to be a much weirder person to decide to do a PhD
despite that. I'm not that weird of a person. Well, I mean, I am weird. Just
not weird in that way.

Right now, I feel I can achieve my goals without going back
to get a PhD, and although formally having the degree would be nice, I don't
want the diploma. I want what the diploma represents. More on that later.


Research Confidence
----------------------------------------------------------------------

One reason I didn't apply to PhD programs was that I wasn't sure
I was in the same weight class for research ability as my peers. My undegrad
research was never anywhere near good enough to publish.
Meetings felt like I was desperately
trying not to drown in new topics and iedas. It was all just a bit much.
Friends in my year said they thought I'd do well in grad school, and I disagreed.

In hindsight...I'm not sure if they were *right*, but they weren't wrong. I'm
more calibrated on my abilities now and think I definitely could have kept up,
albeit not superstar tier.

I think the reason I underestimated my ability is that getting through the first
few walls is the hardest. It's surprising how much easier research got after that.
It's still hard, but I have a better handle on how projects organize themselves
(as well as how they fall apart, which is an unfortunate but necessary lesson).

Let's call this a wash. My research self-confidence was at a near bottom in
undergrad and it would have improved regardless of where I went. I was getting
better, I just didn't realize it yet.


Research Interest
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

> I discovered over the past 5 years that I love being a spectator of
> research, but the burden of being a continual producer of new research is
> just too great for me.

This is a quote from the Ph.D. Grind, and 2015-me agreed with this as-is.
Learning about new research is awesome, in the same way that taking classes
is awesome, because the paper author / teacher has taken care to deliver a packet of knowledge
as quickly and clearly as possible into your head. If the paper or course
is hard to understand, they've failed.

Reality is unfortunately not set up this way,
and since research is about understanding reality, it's much more time
consuming and draining to learn something new. In exchange, the a-has can
be much more satisfying.

I would now amend the quote above to:

> The burden of being a continual producer of new research is too great
> without careful management.

I got much better at work-life balance once I left univerisity. This is
definitely at the cost of my productivity. I got more done in school, but
it wasn't sustainable for my mental health.
There's a sweet spot where I feel I can do research without
burning out, and in that sweet spot research is great.

In short, I'm not
at my max potential. I could be doing more if I worked more, and I just
choose not to because life is more fun that way. Sustainability feels more
important to me right now.

It's intertwined with the Research Confidence section, but another reason I
was disinterested in research was that failing to make progress in undergrad
made me very pessimistic I would do anything meaningful in research.

> When I don't do research for a while, I miss the feeling that I'm in touch with
> the cutting-edge and playing a hand in shaping the future.
>
> [...]
>
> When I do research for longer, I realize how much of a
> novice I am and how unlikely it is any of my contributions will be important.

I've since been a part of some noteworthy papers, and that's helped. When I got my
first email asking for help reproducing a paper, I was pretty excited - that means
people are paying attention! Seeing that concrete thread of influence between
my work and changes in the research landscape makes it easier to keep going.

I'm guessing my interest is higher than it would have been if I went to grad school.
The papers I was on that made a big splash are the big ones with 10+ authors. Those
don't tend to come out of academic ML labs. In a PhD setting, I likely would have worked on more
papers, each with smaller impact, and that would have been less fulfilling.
I also might have kept up the same unhealthy habits as undergrad.


Money
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I definitely get paid more in industry. This isn't my first priority,
but I'm not going to turn down free money.

In academia, more funding tends to give you more freedom. At the low end, if you have
bad funding, you may need more money to live (i.e. signing up for more teaching, part-time
work outside of grad school, and son on.)
At the higher end, if you have more funding, you can do more of what you want, but
I think this is more about the number and nature of your funding sources rather than
the absolute pay.
If you're getting a stipend from your professor, grants from things like the
NSF fellowship, and the grants are general in scope, then you're less tied to any
single one. Industry labs have one source of funding (the company), so you won't
have radical freedom, but you also won't have to think about side hustles.


Social Life
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is pretty clearly worse. I'm more of an introvert, and didn't
talk to a lot of people growing up. I'm not depressed or unhappy by any means.
Through practice, I've developed a long, winding maze of entertainment and side projects
that keep me busy if I don't have the energy to catch up with friends. The problem is that the maze
is too effective, sometimes it takes a long time to get out, and when I do I usually
wish I had exited the maze sooner and socialized more.

University life shakes that maze in a way that working life doesn't.
When everyone lives near campus, everyone goes to campus for whatever event's happening,
and you can serendipitously run into friends in the street, it's just a lot easier to meet people
and hang out.

Those things happen in industry too (there's a reason water cooler chat is a thing), it just doesn't
happen to the same degree. Also, the demographics are different. I just find it easier to hang out
with people in the same age bracket as me, probably because the Internet's corrupted me into
a sea of memes. Age-wise it's a lot more diverse out of school, but that makes it harder to relate
when people talk about their kids, or buying a new house.


Research Reputation
----------------------------------------------------------------------

By reputation, I mean: how often are you asked to review for a conference or
journal? Are you asked to area chair for reviewing? If you went to give a talk somewhere, how
much of the interest would be driven by your name, rather than the subject of your talk?
People usually call this "status". I'm using reputation because it's alliterative.

I find it all kinda grimey to think about, but it does matter, especially for research.
Reputattion matters because it's the way you stay employed. If you want to keep doing research,
you need to both be good at research, and be known as someone who's good at research.
Right now, the
demand for ML / AI talent is still way bigger than the supply of PhDs, so companies will
take anyone they think can do the work. This may not last forever. Ask people in electrical
engineering - I've heard EE companies used to hire anyone they could find, and now
it's hard to get anywhere without at least a master's. And to quote a speaker at the
ICML Real World RL workshop: "if we're in a bubble, and it pops, reinforcement learning
will be the first thing that goes". Unfortunate for me, given what problems I find
interesting!

There's two kinds of research reputation: word of mouth, and publications. Word of mouth
is easier to get - you give a good talk, you make a good impression on someone when
you mingle at a conference, you contribute good ideas during a resarch brainstorm within your lab.
But word of mouth isn't permanant. It's tied to the people you work with and the institution you
work at. People change jobs, fortunes turn - word of mouth alone is not a good foundation.
It certainly isn't worthless! It helps to be "the one who knows how X works". But word alone
is not enough, because lots of people "know a guy", and this means nothing unless the person
hiring you (hiring manager, professor, etc.) knows how calibrated the recommender is.
[Don't End the Week With Nothing](https://training.kalzumeus.com/newsletters/archive/do-not-end-the-week-with-nothing)
is a nice thesis of why it is important to have concrete, visible proof of your skills.

If you're confident you want to keep doing research for the rest of your life, you want to
publish. And getting a PhD is a surefire fire to force you to publish. It'll be tough and painful, and
your papers may not be the best, but they'll be out there, and once the paper's out there,
no one can take it away from you.

When I got the AI residency offer, I treated it as a 1 year trial run of whether I wanted
to keep doing research. I decided that yeah, this was still cool, and decided to go for a
riskier plan: get enough publications out of my industry research to create a PhD-equivalent
body of work, such that no one would care I didn't formally have a PhD. This wouldn't
qualify me for any faculty positions, but I was okay with that.

That hasn't panned out the way I expected. I've been on some papers, but not that many.
I've reviewed for conferences, but I get the feeling that the reviewer pool is so
starved that organizers are asking anyone they can get to review for them. Funnily enough,
this blog is probably the biggest reputation boost I have. My [post about deep RL]({% post_url 2018-02-14-rl-hard %}) is still my most viewed post and I'd like to think it helps get my foot in the door.

My reputation would have probably been equal if I
had gone to a PhD program, because I would have written for this blog either way and evidently
it's the main reason people know who I am. My takeaway is that more people should
start blogs! I don't know why they don't.
Maybe they're
too busy writing papers or something 😛. Jokes on
them, I get to use emojis and they don't.


Research Ability
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the hardest for me to judge.

Getting a PhD isn't about getting a lot of publications. It's about learning how to form and
attack a long term research thesis, with publications as a natural byproduct. To borrow
fighting game advice, practice isn't about winning, it's about learning something, and you'll
win more if you do so.

A good advisor will help you figure out what problem you should try tackling next, explain
why that decision makes sense, and repeat this process until you figure out how to do it
yourself. If a professor doesn't do this, then they aren't a good advisor,
and professors want to be good advisors. It's how they get *their* own reputation. Yes,
professors want grad students to try ideas that they don't have time for...but eventually,
those grad students have to finish their PhDs and set out on their own.

No one is required to give you this mentorship in an industry lab. The more top-down the
lab, the truer this is. Industry labs tend to work on big projects, like "make a quantum
computer", or "beat a pro player at Go", and big projects tend to have more of their
research direction sketched out already. That leaves less research direction for you to
figure out.

On the other hand,
in industry your peer group will have more people who *could* give you that mentorship. Basically,
in a PhD program, you have your advisor and then a bunch of grad students trying
to learn how to do research. If your advisor has time, great! If they don't,
you might be stuck figuring it out your labmates. Based on talking to research scientists at
Brain, the latter seems more common. If you're stuck figuring it out with your
labmates, then industry labs employ people who've finished their PhDs and been in the game for longer.

So like many things, it depends. Basically everyone I know who's left Google did so because
they didn't get along with their manager, and to me it feels like a cosmic roll of the dice
whether that happens or not. I don't have reason to believe the grad student $$\rightarrow$$ advisor
relationship is any different. I got lucky and had mentors who encouraged me to consider
where the field was going, so I think this would be about the same if I was in a PhD
program.


Research Direction
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I started undergrad planning to double major in math and CS, and like theoretical CS in general.
If I had gone to a PhD program, there's a real chance I would have ended up in learning theory
instead of robot learning.

Many industry labs have good theory people, but on average an industry lab will be more experimental.
The argument is, industry labs have access to bigger computing clusters, therefore it's more
scientifically interesting if industry labs work on projects that exploit the comparative advantage
of more compute, because
this produces research of a different flavor. (I would link a post that argues this with examples,
but it was hosted on Google+.)

I find this argument very reasonable, but it puts pressure on theoretical work. Why is the industry
lab paying you, when they could be letting you do that work in academia? All you need is your brain.

From what I've seen, theory work from industry
labs is usually a hybrid of new theory, along with experiments showing that it works. Otherwise,
pure theory work is rare, unless there is a high certainty path between that theory and something
revenue generating. In those scenarios, it's important for the company to hire theory people to
stay on the cutting edge.

I would probably be doing more theory if I had gone to a PhD program, since my research interests
aren't perfectly aligned with my day-to-day work, but it's not that different and I'm willing to
take the trade-offs it comes with. The good part of robot learning is that getting things to work
in the real world makes you directly hit problems that have to be solved for ML research to be
useful. The bad part is that you have to deal with the real world.


Conclusion
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I don't have regrets about my decision. Given what I knew about myself at the time, it was the
right choice.

I also don't have any plans to go back to academia. I'm not saying it'll never happen, but it would
take something seismic for me to change my mind.

The standard advice for rising undergrads is that they should mentally downweight their enthusiasm
for grad school: if you're very excited about grad school, you should only be moderately excited,
and if you're unsure about it, then you shouldn't go. I still agree with this, but I probably would have
gotten *more* enthusiastic about research if I had gone to grad school. **This is not normal,**
and even if it worked out for me, I would not recommend using a PhD to figure out what you want
to do.

If you can get an offer out of undergrad for a good industry lab, and know you'll get a chance
to publish, it's a compelling offer and I would take it seriously. It worked out for me.
I personally think I was
very lucky to get the offer I did. 2015-2016 was a crazy year for deep learning. AlphaGo
had just won against Lee Sedol, OpenAI was founded, companies were going crazy on hiring,
and I was in the right place at the right time.
