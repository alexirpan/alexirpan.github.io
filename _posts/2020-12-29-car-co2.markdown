My car's dead. It went through a long series of death throes, almost making it
all the way through the pandemic, but now it's dead (or rather, expensive enough
to fix that it's not worth it, compared to the value of the car).

I still need a car! Although you can skip one in SF, South Bay is
still a sprawling suburban hellscape if you don't have a car.

I also want to consider the carbon footprint of my decision. What should I do?

In a bid to be more environmentally conscious, I want to reduce the carbon
footprint of the replacement car. What should I do?

Let's start with some crude estimates to figure out the trade-offs, and continue
from there.

First off - electric, hybrid, or gas? This is supposed to be obvious, but maybe
it's not. In high school, one of my teachers claimed that a new Toyota Prius was
worse for the environment than a new Hummer over the course of its lifetime,
because the CO2 emitted during production time was much higher. I never checked
this claim, and it was 10 years ago, but it does demonstrate you should care about
factory-to-driver emissions, not just driver emissions. Let's see if we can find some sources.

The European Parliament has
[an infographic](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/headlines/priorities/climate-change/20190313STO31218/co2-emissions-from-cars-facts-and-figures-infographics)
for lifetime CO2 emissions from different kinds of cars, from 2014.

![Chart of lifetime CO2 emissions](/public/car-co2/eu-lifetime-co2-infographic.jpg)
{: .centered }

The green bars are the share from vehicle production. The top bar is a gasoline car,
the second bar is a diesel car, and the last 3 are electric cars under different
assumptions of clean power.
Lifetime CO2 emissions are measured in g/km, assuming a 150,000 km mileage. This
is about 93,000 miles for the Americans out there. Unfortunately I wasn't able
to find the primary source for this chart, but at a glance, electric cars do pay a
higher up-front cost in CO2 emissions. It looks like about 62.5g CO2/km versus
50g CO2/k, a 25% increase. However, this is later offset by the decreased emissions
from power generation. The exact difference depends on how clean your electricity is.
At the extreme ends, an electric car powered by electricity from coal is worse than a
gasoline car! However, the average EU resident can expect about 170 g/km for an electric
car and 220 g/km for a gasoline car.

A [2018 brief from the International Council on Clean Transporation](https://theicct.org/sites/default/files/publications/EV-life-cycle-GHG_ICCT-Briefing_09022018_vF.pdf)
found similar conclusions. They compared an average conventional car, an efficient internal combustion car
(the 2017 Peugeot 208, which gets 65.7 mpg), and an electric vehicle (the 2017 Nissan Leaf). The Nissan Leaf won out.

Electric vehicles should have larger gains than the ones shown here, because these numbers
are based on a lifetime mileage of 93,000 miles. Most EVs I've looked at come with a 8 year, 100,000 mile
warranty on their batteries, so these charts should be an underestimate of the impact.

Interestingly, for Germans, an electric car is only on par with an efficient gas car, since their power
grid is more carbon heavy. This gets into the argument for electric vehicles I find most compelling:
**gas vehicles are forever locked into using gasoline, whereas electric vehicles will become
greener over time as power grids move towards renewable energy.** Electricity is inherently
more fungible, it doesn't matter where it comes from, and if more of the transportation network
moves to electric, it can reduce lock in of suboptimal technology.

If you live in the US and are curious, the [Alternative Fuels Data Center (AFDC)](https://afdc.energy.gov/vehicles/electric_emissions.html)
from the Department of Energy has a tool that lets you estimate annual
emissions for different kinds of vehicles, with breakdowns by state.
Their US average says a gas car produces 11,435 pounds of CO2
annually. A hybrid produces 6,258 pounds of CO2 annually, and an electric car produces
4,091 pounds of CO2 annually. In California, the electric car is estimated at 1,960
pounds of CO2 annually, less than half the national average, thanks to heavier usage of solar
and hydropower.

Okay. So, we've established that the obvious answer of buying hybrid or electric
cars is better for the environment. Now, used or new?

Consider the chart from before. Around $$50/220 \approx 25\%$$ of the lifetime emissions for a gas car
come from manufacturing. As added confirmation, this [2010 Guardian article](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/green-living-blog/2010/sep/23/carbon-footprint-new-car)
finds that producing a medium-sized car produces 17 tonnes of CO2.
The [EPA greenhouse gas guidelines](https://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/greenhouse-gas-emissions-typical-passenger-vehicle)
from 2020 estimates gas cars emit 4.6 tonnes of CO2 per year. The average age of
cars in the US is [11.9 years](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/28/25percent-of-cars-in-us-are-at-least-sixteen-years-old----record-high.html),
an all-time high. So the lifetime share coming from manufacturing is
$$17 / (17 + 4.6 \cdot 11.9) = 23.7\% \approx 25\%$$
Getting to 25% in two different ways makes me more confident in these numbers. Going back
to the EU chart, the manufacturing share of emission is $$62.5 / 170 \approx 35\%$$.

The three Rs go reduce, reuse, recycle, and that's the order of priority. If you buy
a used car, and that offsets producing 1 new car, then you've immediately cut your
environmental impact by 25%-35%. Right?

Well, it depends how far you want to carry out the consequentialist chain. Say
you buy a used car directly from someone else. That person likely needs a replacement
car. If they replace it with a new
car, then you haven't changed anything - in the end you caused 1 new car to be
produced, and all the emissions that entails.

In reality, not everyone will replace their car, so buying a used car is equivalent
to producing some *fraction* of a new car. If that fraction is $$p$$, then you
save $$p\cdot 30\%$$ of the emissions. But what's $$p$$? Intuitively, $$p$$ is probably
close to 100%, since people need transportation, but is there a way we can estimate it?

As a simple model, let's assume that everyone owns 0 or 1 car, and everyone acts the same
way. After someone sells their car, they have a XX% chance of not replacing it, a YY% chance of buying a new car, and a
ZZ% chance of buying a used car from a third person. If the last case happens, that third person no
longer has a car, and must make the same decision: don't replace, buy new, or buy used. We can define
a recursive formula, by setting $$p$$ to the fraction of new cars this leads to. We get

$$
p = x \cdot 0 + y \cdot 1 + z \cdot p
$$

which solves to $$p = y/(1-z) = y / (x+y)$$. In other words, it's the number of new car sales,
divided by (new cars + people who don't replace their car). Counting new car sales is easy,
because it directly affects revenue of automakers, and anything that affects revenues is
usually measured by somebody. Projections put it at [17.3 million new cars](https://www.jato.com/usa/u-s-new-vehicle-sales-saw-a-slight-increase-in-2018-as-suvs-continue-to-see-market-share-growth/)
in 2018. Counting people who don't replace their car is harder, but we can use numbers
from the [Bureau of Transportation Statistics](https://www.bts.gov/content/number-us-aircraft-vehicles-vessels-and-other-conveyances).
There are fluctuations between each year, but if we consider the 2013-2018 time span,
the number of vehicle registrations increased by 18 million. So let's say
3.6 million vehicle registrations per year. This is the net increase, so 17.3-3.6 = 13.7
million vehicles leave the road each year. That gives

$$
p = 17.3 / (17.3 + 13.7) = 0.558
$$

which is actually a lot smaller than I expected, I thought it would be closer to 0.8 than 0.5.
I'm overestimating the number of vehicles that leave the road each year, since the BTS numbers
include aircraft and boats as well. A overestimate in the denominator means I'm underestimating
$$p$$, so let's round up and say buying a used car leads to about 0.6 new cars to be produced.
This saves 0.4 new cars of production, and you can expect a $$0.4 \cdot 30 = 12\%$$ cut to
environmental impact.

Combining it all together, even if you use the most efficient gas vehicle, and buy it used, you will
struggle to do as good for the environment as buying a new electric vehicle. The ICCT brief estimates a
60+ mpg conventional car at 180 g CO2/km. Buying it used gives a 12% cut, to 158.4 g CO2/km. The same ICCT brief
estimates electric vehicles at 130 g CO2/km, while the infographic from EU parliament estimates 170 g CO2/km.
Perhaps you'll do better, but it won't be by much.

California residents can expect their electric cars to be much better for the environment. Other states
may not get as big gains, but I would estimate a 30%-50% reduction in lifetime CO2 emissions. Additionally,
the manufacturing emissions mostly come from energy needs, so the CO2 from that should also drop over time.

If you're concerned about how well you can charge your car (like me), then you could consider a plug-in
hybrid. These cars come with a smaller battery that lets them use electric power for short drives, then
switch to hybrid mode (using gas) once that runs out. The CO2 emissions will depend on how diligent you
are about charging the battery, but should be equivalent to a pure electric car if you regularly top up
the battery.
