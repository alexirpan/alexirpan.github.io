I had two reactions at the end of Hunt this year.

* Wow, that hunt was amazing.
* Wow, that hunt was enormous.

It is completely insane that ✈️✈️✈️Galactic Trendsetters✈️✈️✈️
managed to pull the MMO idea together. Game development has one of the worst
ratios for time-spent-creating to time-spent-experiencing. It's this unholy
mixture of animation, programming, environment design, and level design.
There's a certain level of detail needed to make the world feel immersive,
rather than shallow, and when you throw multiplayer into the mix, it gets worse.
For Teammate Hunt, we were already sweating a bit at making 8 Playmate games
work, and those were limited to 6-player instances
So the fact the MMO worked at all astounds me, but then the space was richly
decorated, and had its own share of secrets that rewarded exploration and poking at
the underlying systems. perpIW didn't *have* to have MITHenge, but it did.

Funnily enough, I felt I got more out of the MIT part of MIT Mystery Hunt this year,
despite the Hunt running remotely. I've solved with teammate the past few years, which
usually has a lot of current MIT affliation. Because of this, whenever we have a puzzle
that uses something on campus, I defer to people who actually know the MIT campus
layout. For this Hunt, perpIW was knew to everybody, and although the MIT allusions were
obvious, I found it way harder to get lost when I had a minimap I could check at all
times. (Why can't the real MIT campus have a minimap, or a quickwarp function...)
That meant I did more of the "onsite" interactions, and the process of doing so helped me
learn the MIT building layout a bit better.

That being said, I missed out on almost all of the Students round, thanks to getting sucked
in by the Infinite Corridor - by the time I got out, I ended up drifting to non-Students
puzzles and rounds. That meant I didn't do as much of the exploration, aside from mapping
out a lot of Tunnels, and travelling within Giga/Kilo/Milli.

I'd say most of my time this hunt was spent in the rounds with crazy structures, and that
was totally fine. The puzzles were pretty clean and hit a bunch of random niches
(finally, a puzzle about Worm!). But wow, there was a lot of them.

Last year, I already said that I didn't think the scale of Hunt was sustainable, and now I
feel it *definitely* isn't sustainable. Galactic pulled it off, but Galactic Trendsetters
is a team that's consistently proven they're willing to go to insane lengths and bend over
backwards to make the puzzlehunt they want to make, even if they have to write a conlang,
go nuts on interactive content, and run shifts for 24/7 hint support.
I get the impression that they had an inkling of how
much work the MMO theme would take, and decided "yeah we're doing it anyways". Balancing
both a record-setting number of puzzles and MMO development sounds like a nightmare, and
I have trouble imagining the writing process for something that tops this. On the other
hand, perhaps that's a blessing in disguise. There's no shame in setting your sights lower
than this Hunt.

Pre-Hunt
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Normally, my pre-Hunt week is spent flying into Boston, which throws a wrench into my
producitivity for work. Since Hunt was remote this year, that was less of a problem, and
the main challenge was adjusting my sleep schedule to wake up at 9 AM West Coast time.

To handle remote solving better, teammate did some investment into our online tooling. Normally,
we use Google Sheets to manage things, Discord for some coordination, and then create text
channels on demand. This year, since everyone was remote, we made a bot that auto-created
text and voice channels for every new puzzle, along with a small webapp with Discord integration
to auto-close channels after puzzles got solved. There were some rough edges, but it helped
a lot, and although it was certainly different from in-person solving, I felt about as effective
as normal.

A bunch of teammates got into [NERTS! Online](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1131190/NERTS_Online/)
before Hunt. It's fun! But I think you need at least 3 people to make it worthwhile, as well as
fast, precise mouse movement.

I was dismayed at the lack of #ambiguous-shitposting this year, so I made a Conspiracies puzzle,
partly to test our web stack, but mostly because I wanted to make up some conspiracies.
We were considering Baba Is You (because Barbara Yew) and
Doctor Who (because the site was space themed, the 404 page said "in another dimension", and dimension
is the D in TARDIS) for themes. Meanwhile, we knew people from Galactic had contributed NYT crosswords
that got published on 6/28 and 9/9, both of which seemed like nice dates (Tau day, and...Cirno Day, I guess?).
It was all garbage! I expected it to be garbage. All is right with the world.

The opening skit plays, and, well, we still aren't sure about the plot, but we do learn that
automated answer checkers are back, and the rate limit is 3 per 5 minutes across the entire round. Last year,
teammate had a much-memed 10% guess threshold, and we didn't think that would work with the new rate-limit.
We ended up going with a similar system - guessing is decentralized, use a 30% guess threshold, and if you're
rate-limited, let the team know and we'll coordinate it then. Otherwise, the time spent coordinating isn't worth
it. In practice, there was usually only 1 puzzle in a round where we wanted to spam guesses, so the per-round
limit was much closer to a per-puzzle limit, and almost never throttled us.

The other fun thing I did was dig into the source code. (For the record, this was before the warning to never reverse-engineer
the Projection Device.) I found a [solve-sounds.js](view-source:https://perpendicular.institute/static/scripts/solve-sounds.js)
file, with human-readable code building the audio asset filenames. So, before puzzle release, we knew that solve sounds
were back, Megalovania was a solve sound for something, the EC Fire Alarm remix was going to show up somewhere, and so on.
We organized them into round theme guesses, that were *kind of* right but mostly wrong.

Some are either debug sounds, or deliberate red herrings. Of the unused ones,
[5.mp3](https://perpendicular.institute/static/audio/5.mp3) is You Are a Pirate from Lazy Town,
which could map to Charles River events. [8.mp3](https://perpendicular.institute/static/audio/8.mp3) is Super Mario 64 Endless Stairs,
which *definitely* feels like an Infinite Corridor placeholder. [11.mp3](https://perpendicular.institute/static/audio/11.mp3) is from Super Mario Galaxy, which made us think there would be a Mario round when combined with 8.mp3, but it also could have been space (perhaps the Giga/Milli/Nano round).


Yew Labs
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Puzzles I worked on

[Don't Let Me Down](https://perpendicular.institute/puzzle/dont-let-me-down/) - I got directed to this puzzle
because "OMG, Alex Don't Let Me Down has Twilight Sparkle in it!" I took a look, and went "Oh this is the
scene where she's holding on to Tempest Shadow. Oh, that fits the blanks, I get how this puzzle works." It
was pretty fast from there.

[✏️✉️➡️3️⃣5️⃣1️⃣➖6️⃣6️⃣6️⃣➖6️⃣6️⃣5️⃣5️⃣](https://perpendicular.institute/puzzle/%E2%9C%8F/) - This was just a ton of fun. The rate
limiting on the text replies got pretty bad, and the optimal strategy would have been for me to move to
another puzzle, but I was having fun and had to see how the emojis were going to end.

By the time that finished, we had made a lot of progress on the round, and I was surprised we didn't
have the meta unlocked yet. Going into hunt, I wasn't sure if Galactic would keep their metas gated at the
last unlock in the round, or if they would open them early and allow for potential early solves. For the
intro round, we definitely could have gotten the meta earlier if the site had let us do so, and I was worried
that would continue in the future rounds. In practice that was never really a concern - the meta unlocks were
the last ones in the round, but they were tuned such that we usually didn't have the answers to solve them
when they first unlocked.

[Unmasked](https://perpendicular.institute/puzzle/unmasked/) - Hey, a Worm puzzle! I saw it was tagged as
"worm, parahumans ID", but all the cape and civilian names were done by time I showed up. My contribution was reading
the flavortext and pointing out we should track the survivors of the Leviathan fight.

(A fun bit of Worm trivia: in the debrief meeting before the Leviathan fight, one of the leaders says that
statistically, they expect 1 in 4 capes to die. This was real - the author rolled dice for every character,
including the protagonist, and wrote the story around the deaths. No one was safe. If Taylor died, the
protagonist would have shifted to someone in the Wards.)


Infinite Corridor
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This was my favorite round of the Hunt. It was just so *weird*. I had a lot of fun going through
Cafe Five, and cataloguing the differences between different instances of the same puzzle family.
I was also aware that everyone working on Infinite Corridor was developing their own language
on-the-fly to describe the round, and the later in the round we got, the more incomprehensible
our discussions were to newcomers.

Infinite Corridor also broke our new puzzle bot. In Discord, we used categories to bundle all channels for
a round. The limit per category is 50 channels, but it's not like we're going to have a round with
over 50 puzzles in it, right?

There was something vaguely meditative about solving Cafe Five. Nothing complicated, just serve
the customers. You earned comps by serving more customers, which you use as freebies - generally
we saved comps for Rief and for big crosswords that we failed to do by hand.

We had the idea on Library of Images pretty quickly (although I'm still not sure how we got the
right intuition). I was pretty unhelpful on this puzzle, my image manipulation skills are not very
good, but we mapped out about half the letters and that was enough to solve one of the one letter
answers. Meanwhile we were getting nowhere on Unchained. We had figured out the lyrics for a few
instances, but didn't understand how to extract from it. That left Make Your Own Word Search,
which annoyingly did not check off the "Make your own logic puzzle" Bingo square. Although, in some
ways, creating the word search sort of was a logic puzzle...

Our strategy was to unlock around 5 different Make Your Own Word Search puzzles, check all their
rules, then solve just the one that seemed easiest. We ended up picking a Letter Bag constraint
where all words needed to be 5 letters long. It felt hard at the start, but by aggrressively sharing
letters we were able to construct it without much effort, and that unlocked Infinite Corridor
Simulator for us (which I started calling ICS for short.)

Doing frequency analysis on Unchained answers in ICS got us ZITHER as a potential backsolve candidate
for the real Unchained puzzle. That was correct, so one group of us tried to figure out how to
reconstruct ZITHER, while the other group tried to extract ICS. Mostly, we got stuck, and the group in
the ICS chat pulled us back because they had figured out 4 of the 5 extractions. Once we got the first
ICS solve, we sketched out how to optimize for minimum number of puzzle solves in the real corridor.
Our strategy was to use the third letter of the ordinal, since

FIRST
SECOND
THIRD
FOURTH
FIFTH

all have unique 3rd letters. Then for the number,

ZERO
ONE
TWO
THREE
FOUR
FIVE
SIX
SEVEN
EIGHT
NINE

we found that the 3rd letter again had the best odds of not requiring another letter (two Rs, two Vs, the
rest are unique). Unchained was hopeless, but by process of elimination we determined it would give
the 4th digit. Cafe Five, Library of Images, and Infinite Corridor Simulator got solved exactly, but
the few of us who did Make Your Own Word Search warned that the word searches were all going to be
time consuming and doing one didn't make you any faster than the rest. I'm not sure how true that
was, but we did just enough word searches to restrict that digit to 4 options, opened 40 rooms
(accounting for the unknown Unchained digit), and solved all the ICS puzzles we found. We got it on
the 3rd one. (Unfortunately, since we were solving ICS by script, none of us noticed that room
73178 was an exact replica of the real Infinite Corridor.)

I like this round the most because there was this perpetual sense of mystery. How are we going to
have several versions of the same puzzle? How are we supposed to learn the meta mechanic for a
100k puzzle round? That question getting resolved by a recursive puzzle was amazing, and it still
left optimization for the "true" meta of solving the round with as few puzzle solves as possible.
One of the cool things about Mystery Hunt is that you're continually evaluating what rounds are
important / not important to funnel work towards, and it was neat that Infinite Corridor was a small
version of that kind of planning, embedded within a larger Hunt.

We didn't get the low% clear for fewest solves before Infinite Corridor meta. Puzzkill got there with
1 fewer solve :(. We did get the first main round meta solve though, and I'm proud of that.
