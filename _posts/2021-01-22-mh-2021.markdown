I had two reactions at the end of Hunt this year.

* Wow, that hunt was amazing.
* Wow, that hunt was enormous.

It is completely insane that ✈️✈️✈️Galactic Trendsetters✈️✈️✈️
managed to pull the MMO idea together. Game development has one of the worst
ratios for time-spent-creating to time-spent-experiencing. It's this unholy
mixture of animation, programming, environment design, and level design.
There's a certain level of detail needed to make the world feel immersive,
rather than shallow, and when you throw multiplayer into the mix, it gets worse.
For Teammate Hunt, we were already sweating a bit at making 8 Playmate games
work, and those were limited to 6-player instances
So the fact the MMO worked at all astounds me, but then the space was richly
decorated, and had its own share of secrets that rewarded exploration and poking at
the underlying systems. perpIW didn't *have* to have MITHenge, but it did.

Funnily enough, I felt I got more out of the MIT part of MIT Mystery Hunt this year,
despite the Hunt running remotely. I've solved with teammate the past few years, which
usually has a lot of current MIT affliation. Because of this, whenever we have a puzzle
that uses something on campus, I defer to people who actually know the MIT campus
layout. For this Hunt, perpIW was knew to everybody, and although the MIT allusions were
obvious, I found it way harder to get lost when I had a minimap I could check at all
times. (Why can't the real MIT campus have a minimap, or a quickwarp function...)
That meant I did more of the "onsite" interactions, and the process of doing so helped me
learn the MIT building layout a bit better.

That being said, I missed out on almost all of the Students round, thanks to getting sucked
in by the Infinite Corridor - by the time I got out, I ended up drifting to non-Students
puzzles and rounds. That meant I didn't do as much of the exploration, aside from mapping
out a lot of Tunnels, and travelling within Giga/Kilo/Milli.

I'd say most of my time this hunt was spent in the rounds with crazy structures, and that
was totally fine. The puzzles were pretty clean and hit a bunch of random niches
(finally, a puzzle about Worm!). But wow, there was a lot of them.

Last year, I already said that I didn't think the scale of Hunt was sustainable, and now I
feel it *definitely* isn't sustainable. Galactic pulled it off, but Galactic Trendsetters
is a team that's consistently proven they're willing to go to insane lengths and bend over
backwards to make the puzzlehunt they want to make, even if they have to write a conlang,
go nuts on interactive content, and run shifts for 24/7 hint support.
I get the impression that they had an inkling of how
much work the MMO theme would take, and decided "yeah we're doing it anyways". Balancing
both a record-setting number of puzzles and MMO development sounds like a nightmare, and
I have trouble imagining the writing process for something that tops this. On the other
hand, perhaps that's a blessing in disguise. There's no shame in setting your sights lower
than this Hunt.

Pre-Hunt
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Normally, my pre-Hunt week is spent flying into Boston, which throws a wrench into my
producitivity for work. Since Hunt was remote this year, that was less of a problem, and
the main challenge was adjusting my sleep schedule to wake up at 9 AM West Coast time.

To handle remote solving better, teammate did some investment into our online tooling. Normally,
we use Google Sheets to manage things, Discord for some coordination, and then create text
channels on demand. This year, since everyone was remote, we made a bot that auto-created
text and voice channels for every new puzzle, along with a small webapp with Discord integration
to auto-close channels after puzzles got solved. There were some rough edges, but it helped
a lot, and although it was certainly different from in-person solving, I felt about as effective
as normal.

A bunch of teammates got into [NERTS! Online](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1131190/NERTS_Online/)
before Hunt. It's fun! But I think you need at least 3 people to make it worthwhile, as well as
fast, precise mouse movement.

I was dismayed at the lack of #ambiguous-shitposting this year, so I made a Conspiracies puzzle,
partly to test our web stack, but mostly because I wanted to make up some conspiracies.
We were considering Baba Is You (because Barbara Yew) and
Doctor Who (because the site was space themed, the 404 page said "in another dimension", and dimension
is the D in TARDIS) for themes. Meanwhile, we knew people from Galactic had contributed NYT crosswords
that got published on 6/28 and 9/9, both of which seemed like nice dates (Tau day, and...Cirno Day, I guess?).
It was all garbage! I expected it to be garbage. All is right with the world.

The opening skit plays, and, well, we still aren't sure about the plot, but we do learn that
automated answer checkers are back, and the rate limit is 3 per 5 minutes across the entire round. Last year,
teammate had a much-memed 10% guess threshold, and we didn't think that would work with the new rate-limit.
We ended up going with a similar system - guessing is decentralized, use a 30% guess threshold, and if you're
rate-limited, let the team know and we'll coordinate it then. Otherwise, the time spent coordinating isn't worth
it. In practice, there was usually only 1 puzzle in a round where we wanted to spam guesses, so the per-round
limit was much closer to a per-puzzle limit, and almost never throttled us.

The other fun thing I did was dig into the source code. (For the record, this was before the warning to never reverse-engineer
the Projection Device.) I found a [solve-sounds.js](view-source:https://perpendicular.institute/static/scripts/solve-sounds.js)
file, with human-readable code building the audio asset filenames. So, before puzzle release, we knew that solve sounds
were back, Megalovania was a solve sound for something, the EC Fire Alarm remix was going to show up somewhere, and so on.
We organized them into round theme guesses, that were *kind of* right but mostly wrong.

![Solve sound round guesses](/public/mh21/solvesounds.png)
{: .centered }

Some are either debug sounds, or deliberate red herrings. Of the unused ones,
[5.mp3](https://perpendicular.institute/static/audio/5.mp3) is You Are a Pirate from Lazy Town,
which could map to Charles River events. [8.mp3](https://perpendicular.institute/static/audio/8.mp3) is Super Mario 64 Endless Stairs,
which *definitely* feels like an Infinite Corridor placeholder. [11.mp3](https://perpendicular.institute/static/audio/11.mp3) is from Super Mario Galaxy, which made us think there would be a Mario round when combined with 8.mp3, but it also could have been space (perhaps the Giga/Milli/Nano round).


Yew Labs
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Puzzles I worked on

[Don't Let Me Down](https://perpendicular.institute/puzzle/dont-let-me-down/) - I got directed to this puzzle
because "OMG, Alex Don't Let Me Down has Twilight Sparkle in it!" I took a look, and went "Oh this is the
scene where she's holding on to Tempest Shadow. Oh, that fits the blanks, I get how this puzzle works." It
was pretty fast from there.

[✏️✉️➡️3️⃣5️⃣1️⃣➖6️⃣6️⃣6️⃣➖6️⃣6️⃣5️⃣5️⃣](https://perpendicular.institute/puzzle/%E2%9C%8F/) - This was just a ton of fun. The rate
limiting on the text replies got pretty bad, and the optimal strategy would have been for me to move to
another puzzle, but I was having fun and had to see how the emojis were going to end.

By the time that finished, we had made a lot of progress on the round, and I was surprised we didn't
have the meta unlocked yet. Going into hunt, I wasn't sure if Galactic would keep their metas gated at the
last unlock in the round, or if they would open them early and allow for potential early solves. For the
intro round, we definitely could have gotten the meta earlier if the site had let us do so, and I was worried
that would continue in the future rounds. In practice that was never really a concern - the meta unlocks were
the last ones in the round, but they were tuned such that we usually didn't have the answers to solve them
when they first unlocked.

[Unmasked](https://perpendicular.institute/puzzle/unmasked/) - Hey, a Worm puzzle! I saw it was tagged as
"worm, parahumans ID", but all the cape and civilian names were done by time I showed up. My contribution was reading
the flavortext and pointing out we should track the survivors of the Leviathan fight.

(A fun bit of Worm trivia: in the debrief meeting before the Leviathan fight, one of the leaders says that
statistically, they expect 1 in 4 capes to die. This was real - the author rolled dice for every character,
including the protagonist, and wrote the story around the deaths. No one was safe. If Taylor died, the
protagonist would have shifted to someone in the Wards.)


Infinite Corridor
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This was my favorite round of the Hunt. It was just so *weird*. I had a lot of fun going through
Cafe Five, and cataloguing the differences between different instances of the same puzzle family.
I was also aware that everyone working on Infinite Corridor was developing their own language
on-the-fly to describe the round, and the later in the round we got, the more incomprehensible
our discussions were to newcomers.

Infinite Corridor also broke our new puzzle bot. In Discord, we used categories to bundle all channels for
a round. The limit per category is 50 channels, but it's not like we're going to have a round with
over 50 puzzles in it, right?

There was something vaguely meditative about solving Cafe Five. Nothing complicated, just serve
the customers. You earned comps by serving more customers, which you use as freebies - generally
we saved comps for Rief and for big crosswords that we failed to do by hand.

We had the idea on Library of Images pretty quickly (although I'm still not sure how we got the
right intuition). I was pretty unhelpful on this puzzle, my image manipulation skills are not very
good, but we mapped out about half the letters and that was enough to solve one of the one letter
answers. Meanwhile we were getting nowhere on Unchained. We had figured out the lyrics for a few
instances, but didn't understand how to extract from it. That left Make Your Own Word Search,
which annoyingly did not check off the "Make your own logic puzzle" Bingo square. Although, in some
ways, creating the word search sort of was a logic puzzle...

Our strategy was to unlock around 5 different Make Your Own Word Search puzzles, check all their
rules, then solve just the one that seemed easiest. We ended up picking a Letter Bag constraint
where all words needed to be 5 letters long. It felt hard at the start, but by aggrressively sharing
letters we were able to construct it without much effort, and that unlocked Infinite Corridor
Simulator for us (which I started calling ICS for short.)

Doing frequency analysis on Unchained answers in ICS got us ZITHER as a potential backsolve candidate
for the real Unchained puzzle. That was correct, so one group of us tried to figure out how to
reconstruct ZITHER, while the other group tried to extract ICS. Mostly, we got stuck, and the group in
the ICS chat pulled us back because they had figured out 4 of the 5 extractions. Once we got the first
ICS solve, we sketched out how to optimize for minimum number of puzzle solves in the real corridor.
Our strategy was to use the third letter of the ordinal, since

FIRST
SECOND
THIRD
FOURTH
FIFTH

all have unique 3rd letters. Then for the number,

ZERO
ONE
TWO
THREE
FOUR
FIVE
SIX
SEVEN
EIGHT
NINE

we found that the 3rd letter again had the best odds of not requiring another letter (two Rs, two Vs, the
rest are unique). Unchained was hopeless, but by process of elimination we determined it would give
the 4th digit. Cafe Five, Library of Images, and Infinite Corridor Simulator got solved exactly, but
the few of us who did Make Your Own Word Search warned that the word searches were all going to be
time consuming and doing one didn't make you any faster than the rest. I'm not sure how true that
was, but we did just enough word searches to restrict that digit to 4 options, navigated to
the 40 possible rooms
(accounting for the unknown Unchained digit), and solved all the ICS puzzles we found. We got it on
the 3rd one. (Unfortunately, since we were solving ICS by script, none of us noticed that room
73178 was an exact replica of the real Infinite Corridor.)

I like this round the most because there was this perpetual sense of mystery. How are we going to
have several versions of the same puzzle? How are we supposed to learn the meta mechanic for a
100k puzzle round? That question getting resolved by a recursive puzzle was amazing, and it still
left optimization for the "true" meta of solving the round with as few puzzle solves as possible.
One of the cool things about Mystery Hunt is that you're continually evaluating what rounds are
important / not important to funnel work towards, and it was neat that Infinite Corridor was a small
version of that kind of planning, embedded within a larger Hunt.

We didn't get the low% clear for fewest solves before Infinite Corridor meta. Puzzkill got there with
1 fewer solve :(. We did get the first main round meta solve though, and I'm proud of that.


Green Building
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After Infinite Corridor, I moved to Green Building, which had a lot of progress.

[Dolphin](https://perpendicular.institute/puzzle/dolphin/) - A fun puzzle about Gamecube trivia.
I helped on the first subpuzzle after we got the a-ha, then set up formulas for the final
extraction. We got stuck a bit by assuming we wanted the face that touched the Gamecube, rather than
the number that was face-up, but we got there evenutally.

[Green Building](https://perpendicular.institute/puzzle/green-building/) - We got the Tetris a-ha
pretty quickly, without the 5-bit binary hint. I think LJUBLJANA was the one that confirmed our suspicions.
After doing a few grids, we went down an enormous rabbit hole, where we assumed we would find the number
of lines we attacked with according to standard Tetris rules, indexing that number into the answer.
This actually gave okay letters, our partial started AMAR???T????. The Green Building round page was arranged
with Switch #1 on the bottom, so we thought it could be reversed and we might get a phrase ending in DRAMA.
Indexing by attack into LJUBLJANA gave a J, but the solution for LJUBLJANA was especially weird, so we thought
the answer might go to a switch we didn't have yet. Eventually someone pointed out first letters spelled
"CLEAR ALL V" and we got there.

I did a lot of staring at [Complexity Evaluation](https://perpendicular.institute/puzzle/complexity-evaluation/) and [Voltage-Controlled](https://perpendicular.institute/puzzle/voltage-controlled/), where we had most of the data
for a while, but we got stuck on extraction and needed a hint request on both to finish them.


Stata Center
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Extensive](https://perpendicular.institute/puzzle/extensive/) - This was the only puzzle I looked at
in this round. It played well with my skill sets (willingness to try a lot of garbage ideas on
technical data). After working at it a bit, we had all the letters except for the MIDI file and DOC
file. The DOC file was partially done, and we were half-convinced it didn't have a 3rd letter, which
made our Nutrimatic attempts a lot worse. We got there eventually.

![12 guesses on Extensive](/public/mh21/stata.png)
{: .centered }

We did have some tech issues around opening the .doc file. I think it was especially pronounced for us
because this was a tech puzzle, so the people who self-selected for it were more likely to have Linux.
OpenOffice worked for some people and didn't work for others.

⊥IW.giga/kilo/nano
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

teammate had an unusually easy time with this round. It's odd to say "unusually easy" when it took
our team 12 hours to break through the first level of puzzle, but the next fastest team needed
24 hours...

I'd say we mostly got lucky with our intuitions and our data. At the time we broke through, we had solved
every puzzle except Twins (the backsolve), and A Routine Matter. We knew that Rule of Three had
auto-solved on unlock, and knew we wanted to backsolve Twins. There was some forward solve progress,
but we decided it wasn't forward solvable because the image was too small, didn't have clear
steganography in-roads, and every other puzzle in the round looked solvable forward.

We had already made the leap to planetary syzygies, which we found by searching a few of the dates
and looking for space / planet-based results. We also correctly guessed that the backsolve answer
would correspond to Earth. If you read the solution, every syzygy used either the Twins answer,
or the A Routine Matter answer, so we had zero confirmation of any extraction mechanic...however,
we did have the answer TWIX, and saw it was the center planet for the X in GALAXY, so that got
us thinking about ways to generate extraction locations that would get the X out of TWIX. Luckily,
the errors in syzygy identification didn't touch that entry.

A teammate proposed the "common letter gives index" extraction, but wasn't sure about it. Another
group cleaned up our data, and noted that if the 2nd letter of A Routine Matter's answer was O, then
this extraction idea would give the LA of GALAXY. A third person saw the letter constraint on Twins
were G???E\*, and YOLO-guessed GLOBE, which was correct.

Maybe that sounds reasonable, but each step of the process was a leap made on top of other ambiguity.
Doing so is the way to solve puzzles more quickly, but it's also the exact same way to jump into the
wrong rabbit hole. In a clean solve everyone is sure how the mechanic works as they carry it out. In
our solve, it was more like three groups, each with 1/3rd of the right idea, all deciding to follow
through because we didn't have better ideas.

Once we got to the next round, the later puzzles weren't too bad. We mentioned the right idea for Twins
within a few minutes of unlocking it, but decided to try a wrong idea first. I looked at
[How to Run a Puzzlehunt](https://perpendicular.institute/puzzle/how-to-run-a-puzzlehunt/),
but didn't solve it. In my defense, it was 3 AM, and we had convinced ourselves the GPH repo
wasn't important, because we didn't recognize the commit messages in the fork we made for Teammate Hunt.
There was some argument for why the gph-site repo wasn't important...and it was wrong so we never
foward-solved the puzzle. Oops.

We got Twins, I did some Projection Device button holding to help people unlock
puzzles, then jumped on [Nutraumatic](https://perpendicular.institute/puzzle/nutraumatic/)
with some other people. After getting that solve, we tried to break [Level One](https://perpendicular.institute/puzzle/level-one/), because we realized after-the-fact that we could have solved Twins with 0 feeders
if we had just tried in more earnest. The MIT presence on our team helped ID one.mit, and I used some
metaknowledge to figure out the MIT alums. (My thought procss was, if we need to backsolve a puzzle, then 1 letter
is not sufficient. Therefore, we need semantic information, and it'll probably be related to MIT.)
We had two answers, INTERSTELLAR TRADE and BUZZFEED, and were trying to figure out how to use the enormously
long arrow. One teammate declared "if they aren't from the centers, then they're offsets". Another teammate
tried centering the circle on Paul Krugman, and got this

![Nano extraction](/public/mh21/nano2.png)
{: .centered }

Well, that's as much of a smoking gun as you can get - it both gave the E and explained the especially
long arrow. Since the backsolve was intended, we suspected that there would be a famous MIT grad at one of the
4 backward arrows branching out of the Y. Otherwise, the backsolve would be too unreasonable. I had zero qualms
about checking the other 4 locations by hand, and Feynman wasn't too hard to spot when we looked more seriously.
We played around with trying to backsolve the other puzzles, but decided that the non-intended backsolves wouldn't
clue anyone as famous as Feynman, and when multipled by the semantic degrees of freedom, it seemed too hard
to be worth it. That being said....we definitely should have backsolved Questionable Answers.


Clusters
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My time in this round was pain. Not because the puzzles in this round were bad! I was bummed I missed out
on Game Ditty Quiz. But of the puzzles I worked on, I somehow picked the two puzzles we solved last.

[Altered Beasts](https://perpendicular.institute/puzzle/altered-beasts/) - Okay, this one was my fault.
I saw it was Transfprmers, and mentioned there's a Transformers: Beast Wars series. Every Transformer
in that series has a Beast Mode, so we could try applying the same transforms to the beast mode for each
Transformer. We had trouble finding unambiguous sources for some of them, which should have tipped us off, but
personally I thought it was a Powerful Metamorphers scenario, where it was only ambiguous due to
unfamiliarity with the source material. Long, long after I contributed to this puzzle, we figured out
that Beast Modes were a red herring.

[Balancing Act](https://perpendicular.institute/puzzle/balancing-act/) - This one, we were just stuck
on how to do the chemstiry, but after spending a hint we it wasn't too bad.

[Clusters](https://perpendicular.institute/round/clusters/) - We were pretty confident in our
root translations, but spent some time trying to place words in the nicely gridded building layout on
the main round page. We noticed the starting letters, and it looked promising, but we didn't have a good
reason why there was one C and two Ds. Someone went to take a shower, came back and said "GUYS THE GREEK
ALPHABET GOES ABGDE", and that fixed everything. Showers: the undefeated champion of inspiration.


Students
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I actually did pretty much nothing in this round, aside from staring at the Students meta. For a
long, long time, we thought it was going to be about playing cards. On the round page, the order
of meta answers was Dorm Row, Simmons Hall, EAsT camPUS, and Random Hall. Their first letters
spelled CARD. There were 54 students, which could map to a deck of cards with 2 jokers. There were
13 unique clubs, for thirteen ranks. Groups of 4 could be a trick taking game, and an answer with
BRIDGE in it could be thematic and answer the question of "How can we connect?"

It all seemed very plausible. We hadn't connected the four dorm answers to the four Greek elements,
and if I remember right, we eventually got elements from "strangely shaped table", since tables used
for playing cards are generally not strangely shaped.

Oh, one more story: we solved the Dorm Row meta without noticing the Game of Thrones connection
at all. One person shuffled some words around, and found that Roar -> RICHARDTHEFIRST, Family -> RAINBOW,
and Winter -> WHITEFANG made a phrase that looked like it could end in DRAGONS. They
"just really want dragons to happen, man 🐉",
and fixing those 3 answers was enough to nutrimatic out the answer from the potential assignments
of the other 4 answers. Thus continues a teammate tradition - every year, there is
at least one puzzle we solve without understanding why.


Tunnels
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I was waiting the entire Hunt for Megalovania to show up, and it finally happened! Hooray!
This was the round I used the Projection Device for the most, building up a map of ghost
mechanics for each passage way.

[🤔](https://perpendicular.institute/puzzle/%F0%9F%A4%94/)
- This grid is both garbage and beautiful. It is the transcendent horror and admiration you
get from a Neil Ciernage mashup. Helped ID the Steamed Hams Puflantu clip, then swapped
back to trying to finish Altered Beasts, but 10/10 concept.

[Bingo](https://perpendicular.institute/puzzle/bingo/) - I'll let the Discord logs speak for
themselves.

![Bingo unlock reaction](/public/mh21/bingounlock.png)
{: .centered }

For some time, I've had an inkling of an idea to use my Bingo page in a Mystery Hunt puzzle,
whenever I got a chance to write for Hunt. So, finding out I got scooped was incredibly
shocking, especially because my site specifically said it wasn't a puzzle. Astute readers will
note that although my website isn't a puzzle, the Bingo on the Hunt page doesn't, so making
a copy is fair game. Fine. FINE. I got trolled, well played. I'm honored I got referenced in a
Mystery Hunt.

The puzzle itself was neat - we usually do #science on our team log after Hunt, but it was
interesting to do so during Hunt to resolve Bingo statements. At the time we unlocked Bingo,
we had already shitposted many, many terrible backsolve attempts for Voltage-Controlled.
Seeing "Made more than 27 guesses on a single puzzle." made us very suspicious, especially
when we confirmed Voltage-Controlled had 28 guesses on it.

We got stuck on scanning the QR code
though. Our eventual
solve was done by splitting questions into three tiers: statements that had to be TRUE/FALSE to
fit QR code structure, statements with concrete examples, and statements that we believed were
TRUE/FALSE, but hadn't exhaustively verified. Then we split up and toggled statements from the
3rd tier in parallel, until the code scanned. I got the eventual solve, which seemed fitting.
