I had two reactions at the end of Hunt this year.

* Wow, that hunt was amazing.
* Wow, that hunt was enormous.

The puzzles were all pretty clean. The round structures were inventive.
The standout from this year, however, was the overarching Projection Device.
I didn't find myself drawn into the story very much, but the Projection Device
definitely made up for it.
It is completely insane that ✈️✈️✈️Galactic Trendsetters✈️✈️✈️
managed to pull off an MMO, and that leads into the 2nd bullet point.

Game development is the worst ratio for time-spent-creating to time-spent-experiencing.
Okay, maybe stop motion animation is more time consuming, but game dev is up there.
It's this unholy mixture of animation, programming, environment design, and level design.
To make a game world feel immersive, it needs a certain level of detail, which
requires creating all sorts of assets and interactions to fill up the space. On one
hand, Easter eggs like MITHenge didn't have to be in the game, but on the other hand
they kind of *did*, because it's those Easter eggs that make players feel rewarded
for exploration, outside of just unlocking puzzles. Each of those Easter eggs takes time.
Throwing multiplayer into the mix just makes it worse. Doing this on top of creating
a record-setting number of puzzles is nuts. Let me put it this way - for Teammate
Hunt, we were already sweating at making 8 Playmate games work, and we limited things
to 6-player instances. Mystery Hunt was 3x more participants and many more interactions.

![MITHenge](/public/mh21/icsunlight.png)

Now, on top of this, Galactic had to...ah, yes, write a record-setting number of puzzles.
I mean, I liked a bunch of them, they hit a bunch of random niches I liked. Finally,
a Worm puzzle! But last year, I already said I didn't think the scale of Hunt was
sustainable, and now I feel it *definitely* isn't sustainable. I realize it's weird
to say this when Galactic just proved they could make it work, but
but Galactic Trendsetters is a team that's consistently proven they're willing to bend
over backwards and go to insane lengths
to make the puzzlehunt they want to make, even if they have to write a conlang and
go nuts on interactive content. I also know that most people on GT don't have kids,
and some were between jobs when they won Mystery Hunt. Those people
essentially put their job searches on hold for a year to work full-time on Mystery Hunt,
which is great for us, but not something we should treat as normal.
I'm not sure what Palindrome's time is
like, but I currently suspect Galactic had an abnormally large amount of free time to
dedicate to Hunt, due to external circumstances, and that may not be true for future
years.

I have trouble imagining the writing
process for a Hunt that tops this one, but perhaps that's fine. There's no shame in
setting your sights lower.


Pre-Hunt
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Normally, my pre-Hunt week is spent flying into Boston, ruining my productivity for work.
Since Hunt was remote this year, that wasn't a problem, and the main challenge was
adjusting to a 9 AM start.

Normally, teammate creates Discord channels on demand when remote solvers ask for them.
This year, everyone was remote, so we made a bot to auto-create text and voice channels
for every new puzzle, along wiht a small webapp with Discord integration to auto-close
channels after solving the related puzzle. There were some rough edges, but it helped
a lot.

A bunch of teammates got into [NERTS! Online](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1131190/NERTS_Online/)
before Hunt. It's fun, and it's free! You need at least 3 people to make it worthwhile. The
game rewards fast, precise mouse movement, so it might not be for you.

I was dismayed at the lack of #ambiguous-shitposting this year, so I made a Conspiracies puzzle,
partly to test our web stack, but mostly because I wanted to make up some conspiracies.
We were considering Baba Is You and Doctor Who for the theme. Baba is You was because of Barbara Yew,
and Doctor Who was because of the space theme and mention of [different dimensions](https://yewlabs.mit.edu/404) on the Yew Labs website. We also knew people from Galactic had gotten NYT crosswords published
for 6/28 (Tau day) and 9/9 (...Cirno day?). Our conspiracies were all garbage. I expected
them to be garbage. All is right with the world.

Once the Hunt site proper was opened up, we learned
automated answer checkers were back, with a rate limit of 3 per 5 minutes across the entire round. Last year,
teammate had a much-memed 10% guess threshold, and we didn't think that would work with the new rate-limit.
We had some time to hash out our strategy, and concluded that coordinating guesses ahead of time would
take more time than figuring it out on the fly. So we mostly used a similar system - anyone guess anything
you want, this time use a 30% confidence guess threshold, and if you're rate-limited, let the team know and
we'll coordinate it then.

In practice, we usually only had 1 puzzle per round where people wanted to spam guesses, so the per-round
limits was much closer to a per-puzzle limit, and almost never throttled us. Looking at guess statistics,
we made plenty of wrong guesses, but were dethroned from our dubious distinction of most guesses by
Cardinality and NES.

The other fun thing I did was dig into the source code. For the record, this was **before** the warning to never reverse-engineer
the Projection Device. I found a [solve-sounds.js](view-source:https://perpendicular.institute/static/scripts/solve-sounds.js)
file. The code for audio asset filenames was human readable, so I tried loading it directly and ending up
discovering all solve sounds for the Hunt.

| 0.mp3 | [1.mp3](https://perpendicular.institute/static/audio/1.mp3) | [2.mp3](https://perpendicular.institute/static/audio/2.mp3) | [3.mp3](https://perpendicular.institute/static/audio/3.mp3) | [4.mp3](https://perpendicular.institute/static/audio/4.mp3) | [5.mp3](https://perpendicular.institute/static/audio/5.mp3) |
| [6.mp3](https://perpendicular.institute/static/audio/6.mp3) | [7.mp3](https://perpendicular.institute/static/audio/7.mp3) | [8.mp3](https://perpendicular.institute/static/audio/8.mp3) | [9.mp3](https://perpendicular.institute/static/audio/9.mp3) | [10.mp3](https://perpendicular.institute/static/audio/10.mp3) | [11.mp3](https://perpendicular.institute/static/audio/11.mp3) |
| [12.mp3](https://perpendicular.institute/static/audio/12.mp3) | [13.mp3](https://perpendicular.institute/static/audio/13.mp3) | [14.mp3](https://perpendicular.institute/static/audio/14.mp3) | 15.mp3 | 16.mp3 | 17.mp3 |
| 18.mp3 | 19.mp3 | 20.mp3 | 21.mp3 | [22.mp3](https://perpendicular.institute/static/audio/22.mp3) | 23.mp3 |

I was curious where Megalovania would show up. An EC resident was freaking out that 14.mp3 was
the [EC Fire Alarm Remix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1Wwsm2lX7M). We tried to pair solve sounds to
rounds, and it was *kind of* right, but mostly wrong.

![Solve sound round guesses](/public/mh21/solvesounds.png)
{: .centered }

I suspsect some are either debug sounds, or deliberate red herrings. Of the unused ones,
[5.mp3](https://perpendicular.institute/static/audio/5.mp3) is You Are a Pirate from Lazy Town,
which could map to the Charles River events. [8.mp3](https://perpendicular.institute/static/audio/8.mp3) is Super Mario 64 Endless Stairs,
which *definitely* feels like an Infinite Corridor placeholder. [11.mp3](https://perpendicular.institute/static/audio/11.mp3) is from Super Mario Galaxy, which made us think there would be a Mario round, but it could have been generic space music for Giga/Kilo/Milli solves.

The puzzles released, and we were off!


Yew Labs
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[**Don't Let Me Down**](https://perpendicular.institute/puzzle/dont-let-me-down/) - I got directed to this puzzle
because "OMG, Alex this puzzle has Twilight Sparkle in it!" I checked, and it was much less pony
than advertised, but I went "Oh this is the
scene where she's holding on to Tempest Shadow. Oh, that fits the title and the blanks. Alright let's do
this." It was pretty fast from there.

[✏️✉️➡️3️⃣5️⃣1️⃣➖6️⃣6️⃣6️⃣➖6️⃣6️⃣5️⃣5️⃣](https://perpendicular.institute/puzzle/%E2%9C%8F/) - 
This was a ton of fun. The rate
limiting on the text replies got pretty bad, and the optimal strategy would have been for me to move to
another puzzle, since each minipuzzle was pretty easy and we didn't really need more people on it. But I
was having too much fun, and had to see how the emojis were going to end.

By the time we finished that puzzle, we had made good progress on the round, and I
was surprised we didn't have the meta yet. Going into hunt, I wasn't sure how much Galactic would gate their
metas. The intro round made me worried that we'd be hard gated well after we could have figured out
the meta if it were open from the start of the round. This never ended up being an issue - for us,
meta unlocks were tuned such that at time of unlock, we usually still needed more feeders to solve them.
(Aside from Giga/Kilo/Milli, but I'll get to that later.)

[**Unmasked**](https://perpendicular.institute/puzzle/unmasked/) - Hey, a Worm puzzle! I saw it was tagged as
"worm, parahumans ID", but all the cape and civilian names were done by time I showed up. My contribution was reading
the flavortext and pointing out we should track the survivors of the Leviathan fight.

(A fun bit of Worm trivia: in the debrief meeting before the Leviathan fight, someone in
ops says that
statistically, they expect 1 in 4 capes to die. This was real - the author rolled dice for every character,
including the protagonist, and wrote the fight around the deaths. No one was safe. If Taylor died, the
new protagonist would have been someone in the Wards. If you were ever curious why that fight had no plot
armor, now you know.)


Infinite Corridor
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This was my favorite round of the Hunt. It was just so *weird*. I had a lot of fun
cataloguing the differences between different instances of the same puzzle family.
I was also aware that everyone working on Infinite Corridor was developing their own language
on-the-fly to describe the round, and the later in the round we got, the more incomprehensible
our discussions were to newcomers.

Infinite Corridor also broke our new puzzle bot. Our Discord server grouped all puzzles for a round
into a single category. Each category is limited to 50 channels, but it's not like we're going to
have ea round with over 50 puzzles in it, right?

[**Cafe Five**](https://perpendicular.institute/puzzle/infinite-1/) -
There was something vaguely meditative about solving Cafe Five. Nothing complicated, just serve
the customers. It is admittedly similar to [Race for the Galaxy](https://2019.galacticpuzzlehunt.com/puzzle/race-for-the-galaxy.html) from GPH 2019, but having comps and less punishing penalties on failure
helped make it more fun.
We successfully served L. Rafael Reif once, and comped him every other time.

[**Library of Images**](https://perpendicular.institute/puzzle/infinite-2/) - I'm still not sure how
we got the right ideas on this puzzle. We were also pretty confused when our single letter
answer was correct. I understand why it was necessary, but it doesn't change the surprise when your answer of H
is correct.

[**Unchained**](https://perpendicular.institute/puzzle/infinite-3/)
answers. Meanwhile we were getting nowhere on Unchained. We had figured out the lyrics for a few
instances, but didn't understand how to extract from it. That left Make Your Own Word Search,
which annoyingly did not check off the "Make your own logic puzzle" Bingo square. Although, in some
ways, creating the word search sort of was a logic puzzle...

Our strategy was to unlock around 5 different Make Your Own Word Search puzzles, check all their
rules, then solve just the one that seemed easiest. We ended up picking a Letter Bag constraint
where all words needed to be 5 letters long. It felt hard at the start, but by aggrressively sharing
letters we were able to construct it without much effort, and that unlocked Infinite Corridor
Simulator for us (which I started calling ICS for short.)

Doing frequency analysis on Unchained answers in ICS got us ZITHER as a potential backsolve candidate
for the real Unchained puzzle. That was correct, so one group of us tried to figure out how to
reconstruct ZITHER, while the other group tried to extract ICS. Mostly, we got stuck, and the group in
the ICS chat pulled us back because they had figured out 4 of the 5 extractions. Once we got the first
ICS solve, we sketched out how to optimize for minimum number of puzzle solves in the real corridor.
Our strategy was to use the third letter of the ordinal, since

FIRST
SECOND
THIRD
FOURTH
FIFTH

all have unique 3rd letters. Then for the number,

ZERO
ONE
TWO
THREE
FOUR
FIVE
SIX
SEVEN
EIGHT
NINE

we found that the 3rd letter again had the best odds of not requiring another letter (two Rs, two Vs, the
rest are unique). Unchained was hopeless, but by process of elimination we determined it would give
the 4th digit. Cafe Five, Library of Images, and Infinite Corridor Simulator got solved exactly, but
the few of us who did Make Your Own Word Search warned that the word searches were all going to be
time consuming and doing one didn't make you any faster than the rest. I'm not sure how true that
was, but we did just enough word searches to restrict that digit to 4 options, navigated to
the 40 possible rooms
(accounting for the unknown Unchained digit), and solved all the ICS puzzles we found. We got it on
the 3rd one. (Unfortunately, since we were solving ICS by script, none of us noticed that room
73178 was an exact replica of the real Infinite Corridor.)

I like this round the most because there was this perpetual sense of mystery. How are we going to
have several versions of the same puzzle? How are we supposed to learn the meta mechanic for a
100k puzzle round? That question getting resolved by a recursive puzzle was amazing, and it still
left optimization for the "true" meta of solving the round with as few puzzle solves as possible.
One of the cool things about Mystery Hunt is that you're continually evaluating what rounds are
important / not important to funnel work towards, and it was neat that Infinite Corridor was a small
version of that kind of planning, embedded within a larger Hunt.

We didn't get the low% clear for fewest solves before Infinite Corridor meta. Puzzkill got there with
1 fewer solve :(. We did get the first main round meta solve though, and I'm proud of that.


Green Building
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After Infinite Corridor, I moved to Green Building, which had a lot of progress.

[Dolphin](https://perpendicular.institute/puzzle/dolphin/) - A fun puzzle about Gamecube trivia.
I helped on the first subpuzzle after we got the a-ha, then set up formulas for the final
extraction. We got stuck a bit by assuming we wanted the face that touched the Gamecube, rather than
the number that was face-up, but we got there evenutally.

[Green Building](https://perpendicular.institute/puzzle/green-building/) - We got the Tetris a-ha
pretty quickly, without the 5-bit binary hint. I think LJUBLJANA was the one that confirmed our suspicions.
After doing a few grids, we went down an enormous rabbit hole, where we assumed we would find the number
of lines we attacked with according to standard Tetris rules, indexing that number into the answer.
This actually gave okay letters, our partial started AMAR???T????. The Green Building round page was arranged
with Switch #1 on the bottom, so we thought it could be reversed and we might get a phrase ending in DRAMA.
Indexing by attack into LJUBLJANA gave a J, but the solution for LJUBLJANA was especially weird, so we thought
the answer might go to a switch we didn't have yet. Eventually someone pointed out first letters spelled
"CLEAR ALL V" and we got there.

I did a lot of staring at [Complexity Evaluation](https://perpendicular.institute/puzzle/complexity-evaluation/) and [Voltage-Controlled](https://perpendicular.institute/puzzle/voltage-controlled/), where we had most of the data
for a while, but we got stuck on extraction and needed a hint request on both to finish them.


Stata Center
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Extensive](https://perpendicular.institute/puzzle/extensive/) - This was the only puzzle I looked at
in this round. It played well with my skill sets (willingness to try a lot of garbage ideas on
technical data). After working at it a bit, we had all the letters except for the MIDI file and DOC
file. The DOC file was partially done, and we were half-convinced it didn't have a 3rd letter, which
made our Nutrimatic attempts a lot worse. We got there eventually.

![12 guesses on Extensive](/public/mh21/stata.png)
{: .centered }

We did have some tech issues around opening the .doc file. I think it was especially pronounced for us
because this was a tech puzzle, so the people who self-selected for it were more likely to have Linux.
OpenOffice worked for some people and didn't work for others.

⊥IW.giga/kilo/nano
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

teammate had an unusually easy time with this round. It's odd to say "unusually easy" when it took
our team 12 hours to break through the first level of puzzle, but the next fastest team needed
24 hours...

I'd say we mostly got lucky with our intuitions and our data. At the time we broke through, we had solved
every puzzle except Twins (the backsolve), and A Routine Matter. We knew that Rule of Three had
auto-solved on unlock, and knew we wanted to backsolve Twins. There was some forward solve progress,
but we decided it wasn't forward solvable because the image was too small, didn't have clear
steganography in-roads, and every other puzzle in the round looked solvable forward.

We had already made the leap to planetary syzygies, which we found by searching a few of the dates
and looking for space / planet-based results. We also correctly guessed that the backsolve answer
would correspond to Earth. If you read the solution, every syzygy used either the Twins answer,
or the A Routine Matter answer, so we had zero confirmation of any extraction mechanic...however,
we did have the answer TWIX, and saw it was the center planet for the X in GALAXY, so that got
us thinking about ways to generate extraction locations that would get the X out of TWIX. Luckily,
the errors in syzygy identification didn't touch that entry.

A teammate proposed the "common letter gives index" extraction, but wasn't sure about it. Another
group cleaned up our data, and noted that if the 2nd letter of A Routine Matter's answer was O, then
this extraction idea would give the LA of GALAXY. A third person saw the letter constraint on Twins
were G???E\*, and YOLO-guessed GLOBE, which was correct.

Maybe that sounds reasonable, but each step of the process was a leap made on top of other ambiguity.
Doing so is the way to solve puzzles more quickly, but it's also the exact same way to jump into the
wrong rabbit hole. In a clean solve everyone is sure how the mechanic works as they carry it out. In
our solve, it was more like three groups, each with 1/3rd of the right idea, all deciding to follow
through because we didn't have better ideas.

Once we got to the next round, the later puzzles weren't too bad. We mentioned the right idea for Twins
within a few minutes of unlocking it, but decided to try a wrong idea first. I looked at
[How to Run a Puzzlehunt](https://perpendicular.institute/puzzle/how-to-run-a-puzzlehunt/),
but didn't solve it. In my defense, it was 3 AM, and we had convinced ourselves the GPH repo
wasn't important, because we didn't recognize the commit messages in the fork we made for Teammate Hunt.
There was some argument for why the gph-site repo wasn't important...and it was wrong so we never
foward-solved the puzzle. Oops.

We got Twins, I did some Projection Device button holding to help people unlock
puzzles, then jumped on [Nutraumatic](https://perpendicular.institute/puzzle/nutraumatic/)
with some other people. After getting that solve, we tried to break [Level One](https://perpendicular.institute/puzzle/level-one/), because we realized after-the-fact that we could have solved Twins with 0 feeders
if we had just tried in more earnest. The MIT presence on our team helped ID one.mit, and I used some
metaknowledge to figure out the MIT alums. (My thought procss was, if we need to backsolve a puzzle, then 1 letter
is not sufficient. Therefore, we need semantic information, and it'll probably be related to MIT.)
We had two answers, INTERSTELLAR TRADE and BUZZFEED, and were trying to figure out how to use the enormously
long arrow. One teammate declared "if they aren't from the centers, then they're offsets". Another teammate
tried centering the circle on Paul Krugman, and got this

![Nano extraction](/public/mh21/nano2.png)
{: .centered }

Well, that's as much of a smoking gun as you can get - it both gave the E and explained the especially
long arrow. Since the backsolve was intended, we suspected that there would be a famous MIT grad at one of the
4 backward arrows branching out of the Y. Otherwise, the backsolve would be too unreasonable. I had zero qualms
about checking the other 4 locations by hand, and Feynman wasn't too hard to spot when we looked more seriously.
We played around with trying to backsolve the other puzzles, but decided that the non-intended backsolves wouldn't
clue anyone as famous as Feynman, and when multipled by the semantic degrees of freedom, it seemed too hard
to be worth it. That being said....we definitely should have backsolved Questionable Answers.


Clusters
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My time in this round was pain. Not because the puzzles in this round were bad! I was bummed I missed out
on Game Ditty Quiz. But of the puzzles I worked on, I somehow picked the two puzzles we solved last.

[Altered Beasts](https://perpendicular.institute/puzzle/altered-beasts/) - Okay, this one was my fault.
I saw it was Transfprmers, and mentioned there's a Transformers: Beast Wars series. Every Transformer
in that series has a Beast Mode, so we could try applying the same transforms to the beast mode for each
Transformer. We had trouble finding unambiguous sources for some of them, which should have tipped us off, but
personally I thought it was a Powerful Metamorphers scenario, where it was only ambiguous due to
unfamiliarity with the source material. Long, long after I contributed to this puzzle, we figured out
that Beast Modes were a red herring.

[Balancing Act](https://perpendicular.institute/puzzle/balancing-act/) - This one, we were just stuck
on how to do the chemstiry, but after spending a hint we it wasn't too bad.

[Clusters](https://perpendicular.institute/round/clusters/) - We were pretty confident in our
root translations, but spent some time trying to place words in the nicely gridded building layout on
the main round page. We noticed the starting letters, and it looked promising, but we didn't have a good
reason why there was one C and two Ds. Someone went to take a shower, came back and said "GUYS THE GREEK
ALPHABET GOES ABGDE", and that fixed everything. Showers: the undefeated champion of inspiration.


Students
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I actually did pretty much nothing in this round, aside from staring at the Students meta. For a
long, long time, we thought it was going to be about playing cards. On the round page, the order
of meta answers was Dorm Row, Simmons Hall, EAsT camPUS, and Random Hall. Their first letters
spelled CARD. There were 54 students, which could map to a deck of cards with 2 jokers. There were
13 unique clubs, for thirteen ranks. Groups of 4 could be a trick taking game, and an answer with
BRIDGE in it could be thematic and answer the question of "How can we connect?"

It all seemed very plausible. We hadn't connected the four dorm answers to the four Greek elements,
and if I remember right, we eventually got elements from "strangely shaped table", since tables used
for playing cards are generally not strangely shaped.

Oh, one more story: we solved the Dorm Row meta without noticing the Game of Thrones connection
at all. One person shuffled some words around, and found that Roar -> RICHARDTHEFIRST, Family -> RAINBOW,
and Winter -> WHITEFANG made a phrase that looked like it could end in DRAGONS. They
"just really want dragons to happen, man 🐉",
and fixing those 3 answers was enough to nutrimatic out the answer from the potential assignments
of the other 4 answers. Thus continues a teammate tradition - every year, there is
at least one puzzle we solve without understanding why.


Tunnels
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I was waiting the entire Hunt for Megalovania to show up, and it finally happened! Hooray!
This was the round I used the Projection Device for the most, building up a map of ghost
mechanics for each passage way.

[🤔](https://perpendicular.institute/puzzle/%F0%9F%A4%94/)
- This grid is both garbage and beautiful. It is the transcendent horror and admiration you
get from a Neil Ciernage mashup. Helped ID the Steamed Hams Puflantu clip, then swapped
back to trying to finish Altered Beasts, but 10/10 concept.

[Bingo](https://perpendicular.institute/puzzle/bingo/) - I'll let the Discord logs speak for
themselves.

![Bingo unlock reaction](/public/mh21/bingounlock.png)
{: .centered }

For some time, I've had an inkling of an idea to use my Bingo page in a Mystery Hunt puzzle,
whenever I got a chance to write for Hunt. So, finding out I got scooped was incredibly
shocking, especially because my site specifically said it wasn't a puzzle. Astute readers will
note that although my website isn't a puzzle, the Bingo on the Hunt page doesn't, so making
a copy is fair game. Fine. FINE. I got trolled, well played. I'm honored I got referenced in a
Mystery Hunt.

The puzzle itself was neat - we usually do science on our team log after Hunt, but it was
interesting to do so during Hunt to resolve Bingo statements. At the time we unlocked Bingo,
we had already shitposted many, many terrible backsolve attempts for Voltage-Controlled.
Seeing "Made more than 27 guesses on a single puzzle." made us very suspicious exactly how
many attempts we'd made. Turns out it was 28. *Hmmmmm.*

We got stuck on scanning the QR code though. Our eventual
solve was done by splitting questions into three tiers: statements that had to be TRUE/FALSE to
fit QR code structure, statements that were TRUE/FALSE due to concrete examples, and statements that we believed were
TRUE/FALSE, but hadn't exhaustively verified. Then we split up and randomly
toggled statements from the 3rd tier in parallel, until the code scanned. I got the eventual solve, which
made me happy.

\* \* \*
{: .centered }

Speaking of Bingo, we got a triple Bingo on our real Bingo board! The third Bingo relied
on "Metapuzzle solved with fewer than half the answers", which I violently argued was true for
Infinite Corridor, given that we used < 50000 answers. Then we got it for real in Nano, so it
wasn't up for debate.

Funnily enough, I felt I got more out of the MIT part of MIT Mystery Hunt this year,
despite the Hunt running remotely. I solved with teammate this year, and we have
plenty of MIT affliation, so usually I defer on-campus puzzles to people who actually
know the MIT layout. In this Hunt, it still helped to know the MIT layout...but there
was also a minimap. Seriously, the minimap probably 3x-ed my enjoyment of the Projection
Device. When I visit the *real* MIT campus I just get lost, and my phone's GPS isn't good
enough to tell me how to navigate indoors.

I definitely missed out on a lot of the Projection Device (like all of Students and all
of Athletics), but I had fun figuring out how to get through Tunnels and Giga/Kilo/Milli.
