*This has spoilers for MIT Mystery Hunt 2021.*

I had two reactions at the end of Hunt this year.

* Wow, that hunt was amazing.
* Wow, that hunt was enormous.

The puzzles were all pretty clean. The round structures were inventive.
The standout from this year, however, was the overarching Projection Device.
I didn't find myself drawn into the story very much, but the Projection Device
definitely made up for it.
It is completely insane that ✈️✈️✈️Galactic Trendsetters✈️✈️✈️
managed to pull off an MMO, and that leads into the 2nd bullet point.

Game development is the worst ratio for time-spent-creating to time-spent-experiencing.
Okay, maybe stop motion animation is more time consuming, but game dev is up there.
It's this unholy mixture of animation, programming, environment design, and level design.
To make a game world feel immersive, it needs a certain level of detail, which
requires creating all sorts of assets and interactions to fill up the space. On one
hand, Easter eggs like MITHenge didn't have to be in the game, but on the other hand
they kind of *did*, because it's those Easter eggs that make players feel rewarded
for exploration, outside of just unlocking puzzles. Each of those Easter eggs takes time.
Throwing multiplayer into the mix just makes it worse. Doing this on top of creating
a record-setting number of puzzles is nuts. Let me put it this way - for Teammate
Hunt, we were already sweating at making 8 Playmate games work, and we limited things
to 6-player instances. Mystery Hunt was 3x more participants and many more interactions.

![MITHenge](/public/mh21/icsunlight.png)
{: .centered }

Now, on top of this, Galactic had to...ah, yes, write a record-setting number of puzzles.
I mean, I liked a bunch of them, they hit a bunch of random niches I liked. Finally,
a Worm puzzle! But last year, I already said I didn't think the scale of Hunt was
sustainable, and now I feel it *definitely* isn't sustainable. I realize it's weird
to say this when Galactic just proved they could make it work, but
but Galactic Trendsetters is a team that's consistently proven they're willing to bend
over backwards and go to insane lengths
to make the puzzlehunt they want to make, even if they have to write a conlang and
go nuts on interactive content. I also know that most people on GT don't have kids,
and some were between jobs when they won Mystery Hunt. Those people
essentially put their job searches on hold for a year to work full-time on Mystery Hunt,
which is great for us, but not something we should treat as normal.
I'm not sure what Palindrome's time is
like, but I currently suspect Galactic had an abnormally large amount of free time to
dedicate to Hunt, due to external circumstances, and that may not be true for future
years.

I have trouble imagining the writing
process for a Hunt that tops this one, but perhaps that's fine. There's no shame in
setting your sights lower.


Pre-Hunt
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Normally, my pre-Hunt week is spent flying into Boston, ruining my productivity for work.
Since Hunt was remote this year, that wasn't a problem, and the main challenge was
adjusting to a 9 AM start.

Normally, teammate creates Discord channels on demand when remote solvers ask for them.
This year, everyone was remote, so we made a bot to auto-create text and voice channels
for every new puzzle, along wiht a small webapp with Discord integration to auto-close
channels after solving the related puzzle. There were some rough edges, but it helped
a lot.

A bunch of teammates got into [NERTS! Online](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1131190/NERTS_Online/)
before Hunt. It's fun, and it's free! You need at least 3 people to make it worthwhile. The
game rewards fast, precise mouse movement, so it might not be for you.

I was dismayed at the lack of #ambiguous-shitposting this year, so I made a Conspiracies puzzle,
partly to test our web stack, but mostly because I wanted to make up some conspiracies.
We were considering Baba Is You and Doctor Who for the theme. Baba is You was because of Barbara Yew,
and Doctor Who was because of the space theme and mention of [different dimensions](https://yewlabs.mit.edu/404) on the Yew Labs website. We also knew people from Galactic had gotten NYT crosswords published
for 6/28 (Tau day) and 9/9 (...Cirno day?). Our conspiracies were all garbage. I expected
them to be garbage. All is right with the world.

Once the Hunt site proper was opened up, we learned
automated answer checkers were back, with a rate limit of 3 per 5 minutes across the entire round. Last year,
teammate had a much-memed 10% guess threshold, and we didn't think that would work with the new rate-limit.
We had some time to hash out our strategy, and concluded that coordinating guesses ahead of time would
take more time than figuring it out on the fly. So we mostly used a similar system - anyone guess anything
you want, this time use a 30% confidence guess threshold, and if you're rate-limited, let the team know and
we'll coordinate it then.

In practice, we usually only had 1 puzzle per round where people wanted to spam guesses, so the per-round
limits was much closer to a per-puzzle limit, and almost never throttled us. Looking at guess statistics,
we made plenty of wrong guesses, but were dethroned from our dubious distinction of most guesses by
Cardinality and NES.

The other fun thing I did was dig into the source code. For the record, this was **before** the warning to never reverse-engineer
the Projection Device. I found a [solve-sounds.js](view-source:https://perpendicular.institute/static/scripts/solve-sounds.js)
file. The code for audio asset filenames was human readable, so I tried loading it directly and ending up
discovering all solve sounds for the Hunt.

| 0.mp3 | [1.mp3](https://perpendicular.institute/static/audio/1.mp3) | [2.mp3](https://perpendicular.institute/static/audio/2.mp3) | [3.mp3](https://perpendicular.institute/static/audio/3.mp3) | [4.mp3](https://perpendicular.institute/static/audio/4.mp3) | [5.mp3](https://perpendicular.institute/static/audio/5.mp3) |
| [6.mp3](https://perpendicular.institute/static/audio/6.mp3) | [7.mp3](https://perpendicular.institute/static/audio/7.mp3) | [8.mp3](https://perpendicular.institute/static/audio/8.mp3) | [9.mp3](https://perpendicular.institute/static/audio/9.mp3) | [10.mp3](https://perpendicular.institute/static/audio/10.mp3) | [11.mp3](https://perpendicular.institute/static/audio/11.mp3) |
| [12.mp3](https://perpendicular.institute/static/audio/12.mp3) | [13.mp3](https://perpendicular.institute/static/audio/13.mp3) | [14.mp3](https://perpendicular.institute/static/audio/14.mp3) | 15.mp3 | 16.mp3 | 17.mp3 |
| 18.mp3 | 19.mp3 | 20.mp3 | 21.mp3 | [22.mp3](https://perpendicular.institute/static/audio/22.mp3) | 23.mp3 |

I was curious where Megalovania would show up. An EC resident was freaking out that 14.mp3 was
the [EC Fire Alarm Remix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1Wwsm2lX7M). We tried to pair solve sounds to
rounds, and it was *kind of* right, but mostly wrong.

![Solve sound round guesses](/public/mh21/solvesounds.png)
{: .centered }

I suspsect some are either debug sounds, or deliberate red herrings. Of the unused ones,
[5.mp3](https://perpendicular.institute/static/audio/5.mp3) is You Are a Pirate from Lazy Town,
which could map to the Charles River events. [8.mp3](https://perpendicular.institute/static/audio/8.mp3) is Super Mario 64 Endless Stairs,
which *definitely* feels like an Infinite Corridor placeholder. [11.mp3](https://perpendicular.institute/static/audio/11.mp3) is from Super Mario Galaxy, which made us think there would be a Mario round, but it could have been generic space music for Giga/Kilo/Milli solves.

The puzzles released, and we were off!


Yew Labs
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[**Don't Let Me Down**](https://perpendicular.institute/puzzle/dont-let-me-down/) - I got directed to this puzzle
because "OMG, Alex this puzzle has Twilight Sparkle in it!" I checked, and it was much less pony
than advertised, but I went "Oh this is the
scene where she's holding on to Tempest Shadow. Oh, that fits the title and the blanks. Alright let's do
this." It was pretty fast from there.

[✏️✉️➡️3️⃣5️⃣1️⃣➖6️⃣6️⃣6️⃣➖6️⃣6️⃣5️⃣5️⃣](https://perpendicular.institute/puzzle/%E2%9C%8F/) - 
This was a ton of fun. The rate
limiting on the text replies got pretty bad, and the optimal strategy would have been for me to move to
another puzzle, since each minipuzzle was pretty easy and we didn't really need more people on it. But I
was having too much fun, and had to see how the emojis were going to end.

By the time we finished that puzzle, we had made good progress on the round, and I
was surprised we didn't have the meta yet. Going into hunt, I wasn't sure how much Galactic would gate their
metas. The intro round made me worried that we'd be hard gated well after we could have figured out
the meta if it were open from the start of the round. This never ended up being an issue - for us,
meta unlocks were tuned such that at time of unlock, we usually still needed more feeders to solve them.
(Aside from Giga/Kilo/Milli, but I'll get to that later.)

[**Unmasked**](https://perpendicular.institute/puzzle/unmasked/) - Hey, a Worm puzzle! I saw it was tagged as
"worm, parahumans ID", but all the cape and civilian names were done by time I showed up. My contribution was reading
the flavortext and pointing out we should track the survivors of the Leviathan fight.

(A fun bit of Worm trivia: in the debrief meeting before the Leviathan fight, someone in
ops says that
statistically, they expect 1 in 4 capes to die. This was real - the author rolled dice for every character,
including the protagonist, and wrote the fight around the deaths. No one was safe. If Taylor died, the
new protagonist would have been someone in the Wards. If you were ever curious why that fight had no plot
armor, now you know.)


Infinite Corridor
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This was my favorite round of the Hunt. It was just so *weird*. The round techically has 100000
puzzles, but really those 100000 puzzles are variations of 5 different types of puzzles.
I had a lot of fun
cataloguing the differences between different instances of the same puzzle family.
I'm also glad I jumped on this round early, because the later in the round we got, the
more incomprehensible our discussions were to newcomers.

This round also broke our new puzzle bot. Our Discord server grouped all puzzles for a round
into a single category. Each category is limited to 50 channels, but it's not like we're going to
have a round with over 50 puzzles in it, right?

[**Cafe Five**](https://perpendicular.institute/puzzle/infinite-1/) -
There was something vaguely meditative about solving Cafe Five. Nothing complicated, just serve
the customers, and do it fast. It is admittedly similar to [Race for the Galaxy](https://2019.galacticpuzzlehunt.com/puzzle/race-for-the-galaxy.html) from GPH 2019, but having comps
and less punishing penalties on failure helped make it more fun.
We successfully served L. Rafael Reif once, and comped him every other time.

[**Library of Images**](https://perpendicular.institute/puzzle/infinite-2/) - I'm still not sure how
we got the right ideas for this puzzle. We were also pretty confused when our single letter
answer was correct. I understand why after the fact, but good thing we had something willing to
submit H as an answer.

[**Unchained**](https://perpendicular.institute/puzzle/infinite-3/) - We never figured out
this puzzle, even when we tried to forward solve it knowing the answer.
In retropsect, our main issue was that we weren't counting the right things, and maybe
should have listened to the songs more, rather than just looking at their lyrics.

[**Make Your Own Word Search**](https://perpendicular.institute/puzzle/infinite-27/) - Annoyingly,
the Bingo teammate used this year had "Make your own logic puzzle" as a Bingo square, and
this puzzle didn't count because a Word Search wasn't a logic puzzle, but creating a word search
that fit the constraints was very similar to a logic puzzle. Our strategy was to unlock around
5 different Make Your Own Word Search instances, check all their rules, then solve just the one
that seemed easiest. We ended up going for Puzzle 27. (Everyone loves 27, it is truly the best
number.) By aggressively sharing letters between words, we were able to build it with a lot
of unused space that was easy to fill, and that unlocked...

[**Infinite Corridor Simulator**](https://perpendicular.institute/puzzle/infinite-5/) - We
started by doing a ton of frequency analysis, which helped us backsolve one of the Unchained
instances. I joined the group that tried to reconstruct the Unchained solve, while the other
group tried to extract ICS. The Unchained group got stuck and I drifted back to the ICS
puzzle, which had figured out 4 of the 5 extractions and was close on the 5th.

[**Infinite Corridor**](https://perpendicular.institute/round/infinite/) - I feel we split
up work pretty well on this puzzle. One person wrote a scraper to programmatically build a
list of all Infinite Corridor puzzles. Around three of us were strategizing which puzzles
to solve, usually turning into something like the Nth instance of Library Images / Cafe Five / etc.
Another group was manning the Cafe, since we knew we were going to need more tokens. Our
strategy was to find the 3rd letter of FIRST / SECOND / THIRD / FOURTH / FIFTH, since that
uniquely identifies between the five. Then, the 3rd letter of ZERO / ONE / TWO / THREE / SIX / SEVEN
/ EIGHT / NINE identifies the digit uniquely in 6/10 cases, and needs one more letter check to
clear up the last 4/10 caess.

Unchained was stuck, and we thought solving more Word Searches would take time, so our aim was
to get the other 3 digits exactly, narrow the round down to 100 rooms, find all the rooms
in parallel, then solve all ICS
puzzles in that set of 100. We ended up solving a second strategic Make Your Own Word Search,
narrowing the room set down to 40, leaving just 8 ICS puzzles on average. We got the meta
on the 3rd one.
Unfortunately, since we were solving ICS by script, none of us noticed that room
73178 was an exact replica of the real Infinite Corridor.

I like this round the most because it had this perpetual sense of mystery. How are we going to
have several versions of the same puzzle? How would a 100k puzzle meta even work? It was neat that
the answer got answered recursively, in a way that still left the "true" meta of how to repeat
the extraction without 100k answers.

One of the cool things about MIT Mystery Hunt is that you're continually evaluating what rounds are
important / not important to funnel work towards. It was neat that Infinite Corridor was a small
version of that kind of planning, embedded within a single round of the Hunt.

We didn't get the low% clear for fewest solves before Infinite Corridor meta. Puzzkill got there with
1 fewer solve 😞. We did get the first main round meta solve though, and I'm proud of that.


Green Building
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After Infinite Corridor, I moved to Green Building, which had a lot of progress.

[**Dolphin**](https://perpendicular.institute/puzzle/dolphin/) - A fun puzzle about Gamecube trivia.
I helped on the first subpuzzle after we got the a-ha, then set up formulas for the final
extraction. We got stuck a bit by assuming we wanted the face that touched the Gamecube, rather than
the number that was face-up, but we got there evenutally.

[**Green Building**](https://perpendicular.institute/puzzle/green-building/) - We got the Tetris a-ha
pretty quickly, without the 5-bit binary hint. I think LJUBLJANA was the one that confirmed our suspicions.
After doing a few grids, we went down an enormous rabbit hole, where we assumed we would find the number
of lines we attacked with according to standard Tetris rules, indexing that number into the answer.
This actually gave okay letters, our partial started AMAR???T????. The Green Building round page was arranged
with Switch #1 on the bottom, so we thought it could be reversed and we might get a phrase ending in DRAMA.
Indexing by attack into LJUBLJANA gave a J, but the solution for LJUBLJANA was especially weird, so we thought
the answer might go to a switch we didn't have yet. We were stuck there for hours, and then someone
said "hey, have you noticed the first letters of the answers spell CLEAR ALL V"?

I'm pretty sure I started our Green Building interaction by saying "I'm so angry", so if anyone from
Galactic is reading this - I wasn't angry at you, I was angry at myself. Your meta was fine! I was just salty
we overcomplicated it.


Stata Center
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[**Extensive**](https://perpendicular.institute/puzzle/extensive/) - This was the only puzzle I did
in this round. It played well with my skill sets (willingness to try a lot of garbage ideas on
technical data). After working at it, we got all the letters except for the MIDI file and DOC
file. The DOC file was partially done, and we were half-convinced it didn't have a 3rd letter, which
made our Nutrimatic attempts a lot worse.

![12 guesses on Extensive](/public/mh21/stata.png)
{: .centered }

I'm thankful that the computational geometry class I took was mildly useful - not because we needed
to do any computational geometry, but because it taught me how to read and edit PLY files by hand.

We did have some tech issues around opening the DOC file. I think it was especially pronounced for us
because this was a tech puzzle, so the people who self-selected for it were more likely to have Linux.
OpenOffice worked for some people and didn't work for others.


⊥IW.giga/kilo/milli
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This round was another one with strange stucture. At each level, the metapuzzle was autosolved on
unlock. One puzzle in the round was unsolvable forward, and you need to reconstruct the meta
mechanic from the known answer to backsolve that puzzle. That backsolved puzzle then became
the presolved metapuzzle for the next level down. The metas were Rule of Three, Twins, Level One,
and ⊥IW.nano.

teammate had an unusually easy time with this round. It's odd to say "unusually easy" when it took
our team 12 hours to break through the first level of 8 puzzles, but this was still faster than anyone
else for the round. This write-up follows the linking used in the solution page - a link to Twins
means a discussion about backsolving Twins from Rule of Three.

[**Twins**](https://perpendicular.institute/puzzle/twins/) -
I didn't look at this round until people were trying to backsolve.
We had solved every puzzle except Twins
and [**A Routine Matter**](https://perpendicular.institute/puzzle/a-routine-matter/).
Based on [**Rule of Three**](https://perpendicular.institute/puzzle/rule-of-three/) auto-solving on
unlock, we correctly inferred that Twins needed to be backsolved, since every other puzzle looked
forward solvable, and Twins did not. The image was just too small, and didn't have clear steganography inroads.

In my opinion, our solve was very lucky.
Based on searching a few of the dates, the team had figured out planetary syzygies, and due to
general flavor we suspected the backsolved answer would correspond to Earth. If you read the solution,
every syzygy uses either Twins or A Routine Matter...which were exactly the two puzzles we didn't have.
We did, however, have TWIX, and saw it was the center planet for the X in GALAXY. Luckily, the
errors we had in syzygy data weren't on that X.

A teammate proposed the "common letter gives index" extraction, but wasn't sure about it. However,
someone else noted that if the 2nd letter of A Routine matter was O, then it would extract the LA
of GALAXY. We pursued it a bit, and got letter constraints G???E\* on Twins, at which point someone
YOLO-guessed GLOBE and got it.

Maybe that solve doesn't sound too crazy, but each step taken was an unsteady leap made off another
unsteady leap. These leaps are the way to solve puzzles quickly, but they're also the exact way
you jump into the wrong rabbit hole. It was important that we had the answer TWIX, that we didn't
have errors in our data for that syzygy, and that we took the proposed extraction mechanism seriously,
even if the person proposing it later admitted they didn't think it would work until it did.
It's a very weird situation - normally, at least one person in a solve has conviction in all the
mechanics. In our case, it was more like three camps with 1/3rd of the right idea, and we only
pooled them together because we didn't have better ones.

[**Button Press**](https://perpendicular.institute/puzzle/button-press/) - Technically part of the
Athletics round, but aside from Building Hacks, this was the only field goal I did during Hunt.
I was excited to do more with the Projection Device, but because of how it worked, you had to be
first person exploring an area to get the new puzzle unlocks, find new field goals to achieve,
etc. I believe that the people doing Students got the most out of the Projection Device, but
I missed a lot of that because I chose to do Infinite Corridor instead.

[**How to Run a Puzzlehunt**](https://perpendicular.institute/puzzle/how-to-run-a-puzzlehunt/) -
I think this was a puzzle where I knew too much. I had looked at a ton of gph-site code when writing
Teammate Hunt, and somehow argued that the GPH repo wouldn't have puzzle data, since I didn't
see any new commits and hadn't noticed anything suspicious in the older ones. We ended up backsolving
this one.

[**Level One**](https://perpendicular.institute/puzzle/level-one/) - A few of us mentioned sister
cities right when we unlocked Twins, but didn't try it for a while. In particular, I thought
[sister cities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sister_city) and [twin cities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_cities) were the same thing, but when I learned they were different, I dropped the thread since I couldn't get
twin cities to work. We tried some crazier extraction ideas, but eventually someone tried sister
cities more seriously and got it to work. It took writing this post to learn that sister cities
are also called twin towns - now I finally get the title! We probably could have solved this
from 1 feeder, because once we got sister cities to work for 1 answer we immediately assumed
the backsolve city would be Boston or Cambridge so that we could zoom into the MIT.nano building.
Only one sister city of the two matches the (3 5) enumeration.

[**Nutraumatic**](https://perpendicular.institute/puzzle/nutraumatic/) - I don't know if there's
a name for this kind of puzzle. I've started calling them "figure out the black box" puzzles.
They're usually a good time, they allow for a wide variety of solutions and make it easy for the
solver to take ownership of their solve path. (Whereas in other puzzle types, your solve path
is more pre-ordained, and can be less interesting when you foresee more of it.) I think it's
pretty funny that both Mystery Hunt and Teammate Hunt had a puzzle that referenced Nutrimatic.
To be honest, it's an absurdly busted tool once you get comfortable with it.

[**⊥IW.nano**](https://perpendicular.institute/puzzle/%E2%8A%A5IW.nano/) - We looked at Level One
early, in case it was a puzzle we could get early, like Twins. This was a round where having
recent MIT students really helped. We found One.MIT quite early, at 2 feeders solved. Then with
some metaknowledge, I got the MIT alums. (My thought process was, if we need to backsolve a puzzle, then 1 letter
is not sufficient. Therefore, we need semantic information. That semantic information is probably related
to MIT - let me see if I can find connections between MIT and BuzzFeed...)

Like other teams, we were quite confused about the enormously long arrow, because it didn't seem like
there was content outside the orange circle.
One teammate declared "if they aren't from the centers, then they're offsets", which just did not
parse to me, but then someone made this image:

![Nano extraction](/public/mh21/nano2.png)
{: .centered }

and I was convinced.
Since the backsolve was intended, we assumed the arrow pointing to the Y would come from a famous
MIT graduate. Otherwise, the backsolve would be really painful, because it would combine
name ambiguity from imprecise arrows, with the semantic ambiguity of finding an answer that fit
the flavortext and started with T. That seemed like too many degrees of freedom, so we were pretty
confident that if we checked the 4 remaining arrows in parallel, we'd spot something. We found
Feynman, and abandoned the remaining puzzles due to the previous argument that the "unintended"
backsolves would be too hard.
That being said....we definitely should have backsolved [**Questionable Answers**](https://perpendicular.institute/puzzle/questionable-answers/).


Clusters
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Somehow, the two puzzles I worked on in this round were the two we got super stuck on.
Pain. Too bad I missed [**Game Ditty Quiz**](https://perpendicular.institute/puzzle/game-ditty-quiz/).

[**Altered Beasts**](https://perpendicular.institute/puzzle/altered-beasts/) - Okay, this one was my fault.
I saw it was Transformers, and mentioned there's a [Transformers: Beast Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformers:_Beast_Wars) series. Every Transformer
in that series has a [Beast Mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Beast_Wars_characters), and
Altered Beasts sure sounded like we should transform the beast mode the same way we transformed
the Transformer clues.
We had trouble finding unambiguous sources for some of them, which should have tipped us off that this
was a red herring, but I thought it was a
[Powerful Metamorphers](https://teammatehunt.com/puzzles/powerful-metamorphers) scenario, where it was
only ambiguous due to unfamiliarity with the source material. Despite proposing the idea, I only knew
about Beast Wars because of Hasbro knowledge leaking through MTG and MLP. It took us a long, long time
to decide the beast modes were fake.

[**Balancing Act**](https://perpendicular.institute/puzzle/balancing-act/) - This one, we were just
totally stuck on how to do chemistry. After spending a hint to get started, it wasn't too bad.

[**Clusters**](https://perpendicular.institute/round/clusters/) - Like some other teams, we thought
the grid on the round page would be important, but we didn't have a principled way to fill in the
converted words, nor did it explain why the puzzle titles were all from A-G. The titles clearly
seemed important, but we didn't know why there was one C and two Ds.
A teammate went to take a shower, came back, and said "GUYS THE GREEK
ALPHABET GOES ABGDE", and that fixed everything. Showers: the undefeated champion of inspiration.


Students
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I didn't do this round at all, except for...

[**Student Center**](https://perpendicular.institute/round/students/) - Our first theory was
that this would be about playing cards. There were 54 students, which could map to a deck of 52
cards plus 2 jokers. There were 13 unique clubs. On the round page, the meta order was
Dorm Row, Simmons Hall, EAsT camPUS, Random Hall. The order didn't seem obviously unimportant,
and the first letters of their answers spelled CARD.

By that point we were hooked. Groups of 4 could mean a trick taking game! "How can we connect?"
could mean a pun on bridge! It all seemed very plausible, especially because we hadn't
conencted the four dorm answers to the four Greek elements. We only got to elements after
staring at "strangely shaped table" for a while - after all, the tables used for card games are
generally not strangely shaped.

I didn't solve it, but one more story about [**Dorm Row**](https://perpendicular.institute/puzzle/dorm-row/):
we solved it without noticing the Game of Thrones connection.
With some answer shuffling, one person found that Roar -> RICHARDTHEFIRST, Family -> RAINBOW,
and Winter -> WHITEFANG gave letters that looked like DRAGONS. They
"just really want dragons to happen, man 🐉",
fixed those 3 answers, and successfully nutrimatic-ed out the answer from the potential assignments
of the remaining answers. Thus continues a teammate tradition - every year, there is
at least one puzzle we solve without understanding how the solve worked.


Tunnels
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I was waiting the entire Hunt for Megalovania to show up, and it finally happened! Hooray!
This was the round I used the Projection Device for the most, building up a map of ghost
mechanics for each passage way.

[🤔](https://perpendicular.institute/puzzle/%F0%9F%A4%94/)
- This grid is both garbage and beautiful. It is the transcendent horror and admiration you
get from a Neil Ciernage mashup. Helped ID the Steamed Hams Puflantu clip, then swapped
back to trying to finish Altered Beasts, but 10/10 concept.

[Bingo](https://perpendicular.institute/puzzle/bingo/) - I'll let the Discord logs speak for
themselves.

![Bingo unlock reaction](/public/mh21/bingounlock.png)
{: .centered }

For some time, I've had an inkling of an idea to use my Bingo page in a Mystery Hunt puzzle,
whenever I got a chance to write for Hunt. So, finding out I got scooped was incredibly
shocking, especially because my site specifically said it wasn't a puzzle. Astute readers will
note that although my website isn't a puzzle, the Bingo on the Hunt page doesn't, so making
a copy is fair game. Fine. FINE. I got trolled, well played. I'm honored I got referenced in a
Mystery Hunt.

The puzzle itself was neat - we usually do science on our team log after Hunt, but it was
interesting to do so during Hunt to resolve Bingo statements. At the time we unlocked Bingo,
we had already shitposted many, many terrible backsolve attempts for Voltage-Controlled.
Seeing "Made more than 27 guesses on a single puzzle." made us very suspicious exactly how
many attempts we'd made. Turns out it was 28. *Hmmmmm.*

We got stuck on scanning the QR code though. Our eventual
solve was done by splitting questions into three tiers: statements that had to be TRUE/FALSE to
fit QR code structure, statements that were TRUE/FALSE due to concrete examples, and statements that we believed were
TRUE/FALSE, but hadn't exhaustively verified. Then we split up and randomly
toggled statements from the 3rd tier in parallel, until the code scanned. I got the eventual solve, which
made me happy.

Speaking of Bingo, we got a triple Bingo on our real Bingo board! The third Bingo relied
on "Metapuzzle solved with fewer than half the answers", which I violently argued was true for
Infinite Corridor, given that we used < 50000 answers. Then we got it for real in Nano, so it
wasn't up for debate.

Funnily enough, I felt I got more out of the MIT part of MIT Mystery Hunt this year,
despite the Hunt running remotely. I solved with teammate this year, and we have
plenty of MIT affliation, so usually I defer on-campus puzzles to people who actually
know the MIT layout. In this Hunt, it still helped to know the MIT layout...but there
was also a minimap. Seriously, the minimap probably 3x-ed my enjoyment of the Projection
Device. When I visit the *real* MIT campus I just get lost, and my phone's GPS isn't good
enough to tell me how to navigate indoors.

I definitely missed out on a lot of the Projection Device (like all of Students and all
of Athletics), but I had fun figuring out how to get through Tunnels and Giga/Kilo/Milli.
