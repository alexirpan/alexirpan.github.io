*Sorta Insightful* turns six years old today!

If you're new, every year I do a meta-post about how my blogging went
that year. I'll be honest - I've had a lot less motivation
to write this past year. I wouldn't say there's a single reason, it's more like a few
reasons compounding together.

# More Time on Social Media

I haven't checked how much time I've been spending on YouTube and Reddit, but it's
definitely on the rise. Recommendation algorithms keep getting better.

I know these systems work well on me, so I try to avoid adding social media streams.
I don't want to add any more doomscrolling into my life. That means no TikTok, no Instagram,
and minimal Twitter. We'll see how long that lasts. For better or worse, those are
the communication mediums of today, and culture goes forward with or without you.

# Puzzlehunt Obligations

This past year, I've been doing more work for puzzlehunts. It's hard work, but it's fun.
I'd say it's acting as my main creative outlet.

To me, the interesting part of puzzle construction is that you're trying to tell a story,
but you intentionally have minimal control over how the story plays out. You're trying
to convey a solve path, but if you make it too obvious then the solve is no longer interesting.

The more relevant part to this blog is that puzzle constructing takes a while. It's kind of like
game development, where you place the solver in a system, they'll stretch it weird ways, and
you just have to run around patching up all the holes that result. It's also a team project
with a hard deadline where I can read comments from people who are looking forward to participating.
That means a greater feeling of responsibility and urgency. Whereas this blog is a
more personal affair with no strict deadlines.

To put hard numbers on this, based on my time tracker, last year I spent about 100 hours on
blogging and about 435 hours on puzzlehunt construction. It's a pretty stark difference.

# Interest in my Hobbies are Cooling Down

A number of my posts were me writing about something I was passionate about. I had
a post about a [My Little Pony x Doctor Who crossover]({% post_url 2015-09-24-how-an-audio-play-about-a-time-traveling-pony-turned-me-into-a-fanboy %}),
a post about a [My Little Pony x Euclidean Geometry crossover]({% post_url 2015-11-02-friendship-games-geometry %}),
and a post about [Neopets]({% post_url 2018-11-10-neopets-economy %}). It made sense
for me to write them at the time, but I'm less into MLP now, and I'm less into Neopets
now, and I'm just not into fandom as aggressively as I was in 2015/2016. I still like
them, and keep up-to-date on what happens in those spaces, but they're a smaller part
of my life.

So when I think about writing a grand post explaining why I got into My Little Pony,
it's a lot harder to do so. When I consider starting a post about why you should
read *Gunnerkrigg Court*, it's hard because I think about *Gunnerkrigg* a lot less.
There's always Dominion, but at this point I'm basically retired.

What I've realized is that most of my posts are not long-burning posts. They are almost
always works of passion - I bash them out in a few days, or I don't finish them at all.
Sometimes, that passion is a function of the time, rather than anything intrinsic
about myself. I told a few people I was going to write an "offline RL manifesto"
back in 2018, since I thought it was criminally understudied, but it's since become
a reasonably sized research area and that manifesto no longer feels as important.
The post I wanted to write about measurement feels less important now that
fairness / interpretability / AI safety has gotten more accepted.

I know I just said blogging is a personal activity, but I guess one of my personal
activities is writing up hot takes, and takes can't be hot if you feel they're
already known. It somehow feels more rewarding to create a new point of discussion,
rather than adding to or emphasizing an existing one.

I realize this isn't how writing has to work. Preaching to the choir is fun, after all.
However, it's how I'm approaching writing right now. This is likely why I've found
puzzle construction to be pretty fun - puzzles deliberately aim to be novel.

# Settling Into Patterns

I feel like more of my life has "normalized", for lack of a better word. By this, I mean
that if I picked some arbitrary week 1 month in the future, and made a prediction for what
I would do that week, it would be more accurate than it would be a few years ago.

There's just fewer surprises. I'm not meeting as many people and doing fewer new things.
This is all quite terrifying, to be honest. I'm still figuring out what to do there, but
seeing less means I've had less inspiration for blogging.

# General Tiredness with COVID-19

I stopped blogging about COVID at some point, but I remember believing that things would go
back to normal after vaccines were widely available. However, I didn't account for the levels of vaccine
hesitation we'd see, as well as the slower rollout of vaccines worldwide enabling evolution of variants
that (might) escape vaccines developed so far.

Essentially, last year, I could point to a clear future event (conclusion of widescale vaccine trials).
Whereas now, I don't have anything to point to besides rising vaccination rates (yay!) and new
variants (boo), with an unclear sense on which way they'll trend. And that's sapped a lot of
energy out of my life in general.

I've considered whether all this means I should stop blogging. Right now, if I imagine never updating
this blog again, it feels really bad, so I do care about blogging and will be trying to slice out
more time towards working on it.

I wrote 9 posts this year. Some were quite long (average of 3000 words per post,
wheras last year it was about 2500 words per post).

# View Counts

These are the view counts from August 18, 2019 to today, for the posts I've written
this year.

This mostly tracks what I expected, although I'm surprised the post about Flash games
has so few views. Fewer people have nostalgia about Flash games than I expected.


## Time Spent Writing

I spent **98 hours, 44 minutes** writing for my blog this year, which is about
20 hours less than I spent last year.

That rounds to 15-16 minutes per day, which is actually not too bad for a time
commitment (although in practice my blogging is very bursty, rather than writing
a few minutes each day).


# Posts in Limbo

**Post about measurement:**

Odds of writing this year: 20%
Odds of writing eventually: 30%

If I don't write this next year I'm going to remove it from my list of pending ideas.

**Post about Gunnerkrigg Court:**

Odds of writing this year: 45%
Odds of writing eventually: 50%

Basically I am saying that if I don't do it this year, I don't think it will ever happen.

**Post about My Little Pony:**

Odds of writing this year: 50%
Odds of writing eventually: 90%

I cannot see myself never writing about the My Little Pony fandom. It was a huge part of my life,
but I'm ready to describe it as *was*, rather than *is*. Of course I say this when a lot of my
music history is pony EDM...but outside of a few music artists I found via MLP, I've stopped
caring about a lot of the MLP fan scene. A lot of my enjoyment of MLP was dervied from new
episodes coming out, and so far I have zero hype about Generation 5.

**Post about Dominion Online:**

Odds of writing this year: 25%
Odds of writing eventually: 50%

**Post about puzzlehunts:**

Odds of writing this year: 70%
Odds of writing eventually: 90%
