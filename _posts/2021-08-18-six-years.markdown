*Sorta Insightful* turns six years old today!

If you're new, every blogging anniversary, I do a meta-post about how
my past year of posts. I'll be honest - I've had a lot less motivation
to write this past year.

I wouldn't say there's a single reason, it's more like a few.

# More Time on Social Media

I haven't checked how much time I've been spending on YouTube and Reddit, but it's
definitely on the rise. Recommender algorithms keep getting better.

I know these systems work well on me, so I try to avoid adding social media streams.
I don't want to add any more doomscrolling into my life. That means no TikTok, no Instagram,
and minimal Twitter. We'll see how long that lasts. For better or worse, those are
the new communication mediums of today, and their culture goes forward with or without
you.

# Puzzlehunt Obligations

This past year, I've been doing more work for puzzlehunts. It's hard work, but it's fun,
and I would say it's acting as my main creative outlet.

To me, the interesting part of puzzle construction is that you're trying to tell a story,
but you intentionally have minimal control over how the story plays out. You're trying
to convey a solve path, but if you drop too many hints then it isn't interesting.

The more relevant part is that it's a team project, it has a hard deadline, and I can
read comments from people who are looking forward to particapting. I feel more
responsibility to constructing the hunt, and more urgency to hit our deadlines. By
comparison, blogging is a much more personal affair with no strict deadlines.

# Cooling Down Interests in my Hobbies

A number of my posts were me writing about something I was passionate about. I wrote
a post about a My Little Pony x Doctor Who crossover I liked, and a post about Neopets.
Only, I'm less into MLP now, and I'm also less into Neopets. I still like them, and
keep up-to-date on what's happening in those spaces, but they are a smaller part of my
life than before.

So when I think about writing a grand post explaining why I got into My Little Pony,
it's a lot harder to do so. When I think about writing a post about why *Gunnerkrigg
Court* is great, it's harder since I think about it a lot less. I'm basically
retired from Dominion at this point, so that post is also sort of in limbo.

What I'm realizing is that it is not just about the content of the post - there's also
a right time for such posts to be written. I talked about writing an "Offline RL
Manifesto" for a few years, because I thought it was criminally understudied, but it's
since become a reasonably sized research field and it no longer feels as important to
say something about it. I wanted to write a post about measurement, but by now all the
people working on fairness / interepretability / AI safety have said the things I
wanted to say. And so on. I feel much of my motivation for writing is derived from saying
things that I haven't seen online, rather than adding or emphasizing a point I've seen
before. So when I'm spending more time reading instead of writing...well, I see more things,
which means I want to write about fewer things.

I realize this isn't how writing has to work. Preaching to the choir is fun, after all.
However, it's how I'm approaching writing right now.

# Settling Into Patterns

I feel like more of my life has "normalized", for lack of a better word. By this, I mean
that if I picked some arbitrary week 1 month in the future, and made a prediction for what
I would do that week, it would be more accurate than it was a few years ago.

There's just fewer surprises. I'm not meeting as many people and doing fewer new things.
This is all quite terrifying to be honest, because I'm way too young to settle down. I'm
still figuring out what to do there, but that means I've had less inspiration for blogging.

# General Tiredness with COVID-19

I stopped blogging about COVID at some point, but I remember believing that things would go
back to normal after vaccines were widely available. However, I didn't account for the levels of vaccine
hesitation we'd see, as well as the slower rollout of vaccines worldwide enabling evolution of variants
that (might) escape vaccines developed so far.

Essentially, last year, I could point to a clear future event (conclusion of widescale vaccine trials).
Whereas now, I don't have anything to point to besides worldwide vaccination rates.

I wrote 9 posts this year. Some were quite long (average of 3000 words per post,
wheras last year it was about 2500 words per post).

# View Counts

These are the view counts from August 18, 2019 to today, for the posts I've written
this year.

This mostly tracks what I expected, although I'm surprised the post about Flash games
has so few views. Maybe fewer people have nostalgia about Flash games than I expected.


## Time Spent Writing

Excluding time spent on this post, but including time spent on the AI timelines
post, I spent **116 hours, 36 minutes** writing for my blog this year. This is
more than last year but less than 2 years ago. That feels about right.


# Posts in Limbo

**Post about measurement:**

Odds of writing this year: 20%
Odds of writing eventually: 30%

**Post about Gunnerkrigg Court:**

Odds of writing this year: 45%
Odds of writing eventually: 50%

(Basically I am saying that if I don't do it this year, I don't think it will ever happen.)

**Post about My Little Pony:**

Odds of writing this year: 50%
Odds of writing eventually: 90%

I cannot see myself never writing about the My Little Pony fandom. It was a huge part of my life,
but I'm ready to describe it as *was*, rather than *is*. Of course I say this when a lot of my
music history is pony EDM...but outside of a few music artists I found via MLP, I don't care much
about a lot of the MLP fan scene.

**Post about Dominion Online:**

Odds of writing this year: 25%
Odds of writing eventually: 50%

**Post about puzzlehunts:**

Odds of writing this year: 70%
Odds of writing eventually: 90%
