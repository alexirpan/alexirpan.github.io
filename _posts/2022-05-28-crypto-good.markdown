[Betteridge's law of headlines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge%27s_law_of_headlines) says that
any headline that ends in a question mark can be answered with "no". That's not going to apply here.

Cryptocurrency is weird. I don't necessarily hate it - back in 2013 I spent several hours figuring out
how to turn my student AWS credits into crypto. But the ecosystem's changed from a curiosity to something
where billboards and ads are blasted to every space biased towards young adult males. It's a mess, and
to me, cryptocurrency (and blockchains by extensions) are the poster child of a technology that's grown
too big to argue that other people will decide the ethics.
