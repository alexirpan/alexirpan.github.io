I've really put off writing this post.

I've been watching My Little Pony for literally 10 years. **10 years.** Good lord, that's
a long time. I thought I would leave the fandom in 2019, after the Friendship is Magic series
finale. Then
I thought I would stop watching in 2020. Then I thought I would stop in 2021...and here I am.

I've known for a long time that I wanted to write something about what My Little Pony means
to me, but I've put it off for a long time because it brings up a complicated group of emotions and
ideas that are hard to explain. At the same time, I knew I had to write this post. So let's get
started.


How Did I Get Into My Little Pony?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Just so we're clear, I'm not trying to get anybody into the show with this post. I decided long ago
that it wasn't worth doing so. But, I can't explain what the My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic
fandom means to me if I don't explain its appeal.

I started around 2011, in the hiatus between Season 1 and 2. I was
a high school student attending Canada/USA Mathcamp that summer.
Mathcamp is a summer math program that introduces talented high school students to interesting
university level maths, like topology or complexity theory. One thing special about Mathcamp is that
it encourages student-organized events. As long as you get enough staff to agree to supervise,
students can organize anything they want. The brony phenemenon was in full swing, a few students were fans,
some *staff* were fans, and they organized a watch party. I went, watched a few episodes, saw the appeal,
and resolved to catch up on the season later.

Not everyone who went got it. I distinctly remember one staff who wanted to give the show a chance,
but was competely baffled why it was popular after watching a few episodes. We had just finished
"Cal of the Cutie", so we all called him a blank flank, which just sparked more confusion.
Good times.

Season 2 started out really strong, and I stuck with the show all the way until its finale in 2019.
Friendship is Magic has its ups
and downs, but at its core it's a wholesome, well-animated cartoon that shifts between light
low continuity slice of life episodes, and high fantasy adventures where the fate of the world is at
stake. The characters have fun personalities, they play off each other well, and then occasionally it
turns into a magical girl anime with big laser beam fights.
What's not to like?

Of course, people got mad or got the wrong idea. *No*, it's not about the 1980s Generation 1 cartoon,
it's almost exclusively about the Generation 4 Friendship is Magic one. *No*, it's not some fetish thing,
most of the fandom just likes the show. (There was some porn, because people are always horny, but it
wasn't a focal point.) *No*, it wasn't some elaborate gaslighting ironic joke. Maybe for some it was,
but people just genuninely liked the show.

There was other criticism too. "I can't believe you're watching a kid's show."
When people said this, I don't think they actually mean "shows made
for kids can't be good." All of Pixar and Disney's best work is a clear counterexample.
I think they really meant that it's easier to get away with a bad cartoon that's all flash and
no substance if you market it to kids. A lot of people mentally bucketed My Little Pony as one
of those shows, although that may have been true before (Generation 3.5 is legendarily bad),
it wasn't true of this show.
Yeah, Friendship is Magic is an advertising vehicle, but it's a fun advertising vehicle. Sometimes
making something good is the right way to make money.

I wouldn't say the writers succeeded all the time. Episodes have incredibly varying quality. The stinkers are
really bad, but the good ones are *really* good. I'm not sure how well it works if you aren't
invested in the characters, but "The Perfect Pear"? *So good*.

![Perfect Pear](/public/why-mlp/pear.webp)
{: .centered }

Even so, a good show doesn't explain why the fandom got so big during 2010-2013. I've heard a brony
describe it as a lightning in a bottle, and I think that's true - it was primarily dumb luck, amplified
through the Internet until it could run on its own.

In 2006, the sociology researchers Salganik, Dodds, and Watts had a question: given that every publisher
wants to identify the next hit song, why is predicting song popularity so hard? They came up with
the [Music Lab](http://www.princeton.edu/~mjs3/musiclab.shtml),
an artificial music platform. Participants were asked to listen and rank new songs. Optionally, some groups
were allowed to see rankings from previous participants.

The [paper](http://www.princeton.edu/~mjs3/salganik_dodds_watts06_full.pdf) is here, and
the short version is that song popularity was just genuinely unpredictable. A popular song in one group
would be less popular with the next. Interestingly, the more people observed other people's rankings,
the more volatile the popularity would be. The theory is that there is always some level of herd
mentality - if it's popular, it's more likely to retain popularity.
I assume these dynamics are even stronger now compared to 2006, given a bigger Internet and stronger
recommendation systems.

In most realities, My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic is a
quietly successful cartoon, that sells a bunch of toys, and otherwise leaves no mark on popular culture,
outside a bit of nostlagia many years later.
In our reality, it won the cosmic lottery. The premise and size made it too novel to ignore.
Not the premise of the show: the premise of the *fandom*.
"Several 13 to 30 year old men swear up and down that the new My Little Pony
show is worth watching" was a bizarre enough meme to spread far and overpower many existing aversions.
The only reason I gave MLP a chance was because
I was into Homestuck at the time, and MLP profile pics and references were appearing on the MSPA
forums.

The show staff certainly didn't expect it. The last BronyCon was in 2019, and in a panel with showrunner
Lauren Faust and writer M. A. Larson, they talked about
[the day they watched a bunch of Russian teenagers](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/cezmyc/yo_reddit_im_ma_larson_writer_on_my_little_pony/eu688z7/?context=8&depth=9) singing
along to *Winter Wrap-Up*. In that moment, this thing they never predicted clarified into something
real. The only thing left was deciding what to do about it.

"Fans are Great. Fandom is Weird"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Of course, there were haters. Every culture creates its counterculture. Bronies are no different.
Even so, bronies got it especially bad. It was astoundingly difficult for fans to explain the appeal
to outsiders, and it was incredibly easy to write off the whole thing as a bunch of weirdos.

This may be an unpopular opinion, but the MLP fandom *totally* deserved it. The kids didn't deserve
to be bullied, but you know the old saying:
"Fans are great. Fandom is weird." (Supposedly
this was said by Terry Pratchett, but I've never found a clear source.)
I've yet to see any fandom
that wasn't weird in one way or another. And, look, I mean this in the most endearing way
possible, but I've been in Touhou fandom. I've been in Homestuck fandom. Let's say
I have a *pretty calibrated* sense of how weird fandoms can get, and MLP fandom was and is **weird**. That's
why I love it.

Things like "welcome to the herd" are weird. Making up entire
backstories for ponies that appear in the background of a single episode is weird. How were there
already elaborate backstories for Derpy, Lyra, Bon-Bon, Octavia, and Vinyl, before any of them got
official speaking lines or canon stories of any kind? Then there was the endless fan music sampling
vocal pony chops. Elements of this appear in a lot of fandoms, but brony fandom was unusually
prolific. The only good explanation for this level of content is passion, but this isn't a good
explanation at all, because it just punts the question to why people were so passionate about
a show that was good, but certainly not the Second Coming of Jesus.

For their part, the show staff supported the fandom, and Hasbro said they didn't plan to shut the fandom
down, given it was free publicity. They made a poster for San Diego Comic Con 2011, and starting with
Season 2, they made slight nods to the adult fandom here and there.

![Pony poster](/public/why-mlp/ponyposter.jpg)
{: .centered }

I don't think Hasbro could have shut down the fandom even if they wanted to. It was bigger than them
now.

\* \* \*
{: .centered }

I've come to realize that I put a lot of respect on people who take a nonsense idea, with minimal
usefulness to the real world, and just run with it to completion because they want to. There's too
many people who drop things at the first signs of resistance, and I'd rather live in a world where people follow
through.

In general, fandom is driven by untapped potential. If someone does good worldbuilding,
you bet people are going do more things in that world. In this
respect, Friendship is Magic was almost hyperoptimized for fandom.
The ensemble cast made it easy for
fans to find some character they found compelling. The show makes frequent allusions to world
mythology, the history of Equestria, and kingdoms never shown in the show. These are rightly
skipped because they don't serve the plot, but unanswered questions beg answers.

There are also out-of-universe factors. When Hasbro wants a new toy line, the writers have to write
it into the show, whether it makes sense or not. According to rumor, the Season 3 finale felt so
rushed because the writers begged (and failed) to get network executives to sign off on a 2-part
episode. Sometimes, it isn't even the executive's faults - the writers just drop the ball and
put out a bad episode.
And, since Friendship is Magic has to stay family-friendly, there's inherent constraints on what the
show staff is allowed to depict.

There's untapped potential everywhere in Friendship is Magic, and you couldn't ask for a better sandbox to
play in. And fans did play in it. They did all kinds of crazy shit. Sturgeon's Law still applies, but
MLP fandom was prolific enough for lots of solid content.

Want a voice-acted 9 hour [Ace Attorney x MLP crossover video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUDfoZGhLjE)?
Sure, why not. *Turnabout Storm* is slow at times, but it does a great job at capturing the tone of
Ace Attorney, has lots of shout-outs to both IPs, and the case's resolution is excellent. Similarly, when I reread
[Fallout Equestria](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/119190/fallout-equestria),
I felt it still held up as a case study in how to write a protagonist who uses their abilities to
their full potential, and villains with clear end goals.

Those are both stupidly long, so if you want something shorter, how about [Ponycraft 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJbAT1wzS8U) or [Shingeki no Pony](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sj4yJ4MPYA)? Both
are playing in the what-if space of "what if My Little Pony was a darker, more violent show",
crossing over with Starcraft and Attack on Titan respectively, and there's some inherent humor
in the juxtaposition between the two.

Want something without a crossover? Well, it's not as popular, but I'll always talk up
the pony music video [The Stars Will Aid in Her Escape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdhSb-L3hf8).
set to "Cosmic Love" by Florence and the Machine.
Although they were definitely made separately, it's a cool discovered association between the song
and the series opening, especially with the drawn parallels between Twilight and Luna, and the observation
that both twilight the time and Twilight the character act as the bridge between Sun and Moon.

In some ways, I feel fan content can be better than original content.
Fanwork is like painting a tapestry, but instead of the standard
colors like red and blue, you get more exotic colors like Reimu or Papyrus. This is inherently
more limiting, and cuts off the target audience, but in exchange, that fan work can convey very
specific feelings or ideas to fans that understand the references. Or, put another way: original
work can include references and allusions if it wants to, but it can rarely make those allusions
be central to its experience, whereas fan work can be written for very specific niches and assume
that most viewers have the requisite background.

It may not objectively be higher
quality, but it can subjectively be better, and when it comes to entertainment, you like what
you like.


Falling Down the Rabbit Hole
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Why?* Why does any of fan content exist? I've touched on it earlier, but I'll repeat why: people
wanted to make it. Perhaps it's silly that fans
ascribed so much meaning to an IP that could carry on without them, and which has minimal real-life
value. Personally though, I think this world is inherently a pretty brutal place. It's easy for
people to get beaten down and get nihilistic in an uncaring universe. Anything that fights against that
is good.

> I remember during the aughts, when I was first trying to work my way into sports media, the popular line among the cool kids was that things like sports are a distraction that monopolizes peoples’ attention and energy that otherwise would go into enacting real political change. But things like sports are the fucking point! MMA, or learning how to play the lap steel, or thrift fashion, or Counter-Strike, or Scrubs fan fiction, or whatever in the world it is for you. That’s what you’re fighting for, if you’re fighting. Every hour you get to spend in that world is your victory against all this.

[(Fighting in the Age of Loneliness: A Conversation with Felix and Jon)](https://www.sbnation.com/secret-base/2020/12/29/22202391/fighting-in-the-age-of-loneliness-mma-documentary)
{: .centered }

I've come to realize that I put a lot of respect on people who take a nonsense idea, with minimal
usefulness to the real world, and just run with it to completion because they want to. Their lack of
usefulness is almost the entire point. *No*, this doesn't make me real money. It doesn't make me
more intelluctual. It's just a thing I do, in the time I have. Nonsense only exists because we're
serious about making it. There's too many things that get dropped when it gets hard, and I'd rather
live in a world where people keep going.

The deeper you go, the more examples you can find of fans building off other fans, engines of creation
spinning further away from show canon. Fallout Equestria inpired
not one, but [two](https://absolutelyeverything.org/) different fanfiction [print projects](https://www.ministryofimage.net/).
The former focuses on just the Fallout Equestria universe, while the latter takes its name from FoE and
prints a wider selection MLP fanfic, if you can stomach the shipping cost from Russia).

*Fighting is Magic* was a 2D fighting game made by a group of fans who knew what they were doing, making
enough progress to show it off at side events for Evo, one of the biggest fighting game tournaments in the
world. They were hit with a cease and desist letter from Hasbro, and they complied, shutting down all development.
In response, Lauren Faust offered to do some character design work, Skullgirls licensed their engine to the
team thanks to a Kickstarter goal, and they redid all their work, renaming themselves to *Them's Fightin' Herds*.
Six years after their first build, they released on Steam in early access. The game still receives updates today, and although many features are still in development, its existence at all is a bit of a miracle.

> I dunno how familiar people are with fan projects, but there are probably hundreds of ideas for fan projects starting every day. I would say 99% of them never go beyond the idea phase. It’s exceedingly unlikely that any given fan project will go anywhere at all, let alone stick together for as long as we have. Of the ones that do get past the idea phase, most of them are filled with passion, but are lacking skills. [...] The tiny team we started with, from a random collection of people who happened to see a single post on a single forum at a certain time happened to get along and have the drive and skills that complemented each other and most of the gaps were filled right off the bat.

{: .centered }

The game has been divorced from its My Little Pony origins for years, but its thanks to the show
that it exists at all, and I'm happy its moving towards its own identity. They released their
first new character this year, and she's **sick**.

I think this is most exemplified by
[Lullaby for a Princess](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7PQ9IO-7fU), an animation by WarpOut. It's only
7 minutes long, and there's a good argument that it's the best thing the fandom's ever done.

The backing song "Lullaby for a Princess" by ponyphonic, another fan artist
who imagined a song Celestia would sing to Luna after banishing her to the moon. WarpOut got inspired,
and decided to animate it with an exceptionally high quality bar. The animation is handmade, frame by frame.
The backgrounds are watercolor - as in, some are watercolor on physical paper.
The meat and potatoes of animating was done by one person, averaging 0.5 seconds of footage per day.

Much of my interaction with the fandom now is just through the pony brony music scene (which yes, is a thing).
You've got [Ponies at Dawn](https://poniesatdawn.bandcamp.com/) as the
"big" label, but then there are smaller labels like [Equinity](https://equinity.bandcamp.com/) and
new labels like [VibePoniez](https://vibeponiez.bandcamp.com/) curating more lofi music. Which all feeds into
sites like the [Equestrian Trot 100](http://trot100.blogspot.com/) (no longer maintained), or [Horse Music Herald](https://horsemusicherald.com/)
which shares new releases.

These songs get a few thousand views. The launch parties get around 100 to 200 listeners. Nothing crazy,
but good enough for people to keep tuning in. Sometimes, you have to write a song. If My Little Pony is
the inspiration, so be it. Maybe somewhat fittingly, my favorite song from the pony music community is
also a remix of another fan song - Wasteand Wailers' acoustic cover of On Hold by YourEnigma.

There was a certain energy in the fandom, where people felt empowered to make whatever
they wanted, along with an assuredness worn by fans who knew the community would keep growing and
last forever. And like every group in history, they were wrong.


Time Marches On
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Compared to what it was in the early years, the brony fandom's a shell of what it was. The golden age
is over and what's left is much less definable. People in the fandom will get upset if you claim it's
dead, but it feels unlikely it'll ever recover in size to what it once was.

You could try to blame it on Season 3. Controversial at the time, and still near the bottom of
["best season" polls](https://www.equestriadaily.com/2018/12/poll-results-what-is-best-season-of-my.html).
You could blame it on the shifts in the show's tone. As the show evolved, it
"grew up", making more nods to the adult audience, which not everybody liked. Some felt this cheapened
the innocence of the show, or that giving fans what they wanted made the show worse for non-fans.
I think the most likely explanation is that it's the same thing that happened to
Pokemon Go. For a short time, the world collectively had a fever dream and got in on the hype.
Then the hype faded and the world moved on.

I've long hesitated to call myself a brony, even though I've watched the entire series, read about
2 million words of fanfic,
created a custom Dominion expansion that I tried to get into Equestria Daily, and most recently
led writing for [My Little Pony: Puzzles are Magic](https://www.puzzlesaremagic.com/), an MLP-themed
puzzlehunt.

I will let the defunct ethnography blog [Research is Magic](https://web.archive.org/web/20150120223532/http://www.researchismagic.org/2014/04/what-sort-of-group-are-bronies/#more-520) explain why.

> In my dissertation research, I study people who self-identify as Vietnamese and how they form connections with one another in local communities, on national and continental levels, and even transnationally. I’ve purposefully avoided categories like “Vietnamese Americans” or “the Vietnamese diaspora” because they tend to presuppose certain sorts of relationships that people may or may not have with each other [...]. Therefore, I have often used terminology like ‘self-identify as Vietnamese” because the identification of oneself as Vietnamese means that a person is self-consciously engaged in **identity work** of a sort that produces potential links to other people who also self-identify as Vietnamese.
>
> [...]
>
> Kurt and I say often, “I’m not sure I’m a brony,” and we have both wondered about what keeps either of us from taking the plunge, so to speak. I would venture a guess that our anxiety stems from an incongruity between the moment we started to construct for ourselves an idea of a brony community and its relationship to our other affiliations. For me at least, I had been a casual viewer of the show for a long time. Even once I heard that bronies were a thing, I did not feel a need to reevaluate my watching of the show in those terms. I was part of the public/counterpublic in the sense we began with—of a kind of rapt attention to a cultural object—but since there was no utility for me in identifying with others, I felt no need to do the associated identity work.
>
> Once Kurt and I decided we were going to do research on bronies, then the community became a “thing” for us…but it also meant that we at that same moment already had identities vis-a-vis that thing: brony **researchers**. Having produced the relationship with the fandom as one of a scholarly gaze, it’s been difficult to take on the brony label, even though we’re often doing exactly the same thing bronies are. The way the imagined community is imagined, the moment at which it is imagined, and a person’s relationship to that imagined thing all become important considerations.

{: .centered }

I've always preferred calling myself an "MLP fan" or "member of the fandom", and I know I'm not alone.
When I went through the feedback for Puzzles are Magic, I saw someone say they've seen every episode, but don't
consider themselves a brony. Or a couple said they and their partner called each other Flutter Butter and Dashie,
but they didn't consider themselves bronies. And then meanwhile, I go to a pony convention, where you would
assume everyone self-identifies as a brony, and they mention they're 2 seasons behind the show, when you'd
think watching the whole show would be a pre-requisite.

The people who call themselves bronies are the ones who found a sense of fellowship in adopting the label. I
never really found that sense of belonging. It was fun to watch the show, and watch fan content, but I never
took the jump to make a forum account, actively participate in fandom discussion, or work on fan projects
with people I didn't know IRL.

It's for these reasons that I found myself having less fun at brony conventions. The first one was great,
but afterwards, not so much.
Most fandoms have this pyramid of intensity. Of all the viewers, some become fans. Of those fans,
some produce content or go to fan sites. Of people there, only some go to conventions. So at conventions,
you don't meet the average fan. You meet the super hardcore fans. Which to me is split between very cool
people, and people I never want to interact with in my life. (I feel I have a similar reaction to Bay
Area rationalists.) Dealing with the people I don't want to interact with takes up all the energy I have
to meet everyone else.

The people I get along with realize the absurdity of the situation, and just go along with it. They
can seamlessly jump between hating on your favorite pony, and asking if you want to join them for
lunch. Maybe they acknowledge that they're only sort of there for the ponies. Or, they come up with
genuinely impressive surrealist humor. I have yet to hear a more brain-stopping question than
"If you could ship Twilight Sparkle with any pre-2000 US President, which would you pick?"

Maybe it's just because of the demographics, but man is there a lot of shitposting. Like donating
an empty box of Froot Loops for the charity auction (except it's signed by the Toucan Sam
voice actor, which gives it some value).

Or, well, this nonsense from 2018.

You know if this kind of humor works for you. For me, it does. I appreciated getting to watch someone
do a live rendition of "We Are Number One" in full Robbie Rotten cosplay.

But, memes often don't have any deeper meaning.
The more I spent more time in these convention spaces, the
more I started to see the dreary plain white conference room walls instead of the magic. Going to a panel
and watching someone who couldn't work a room address a room at 1/3rd capacity just felt depressing.
Not to mention seeing content creators whose work I respected just acting like assholes, or seeing
people that seemed like they were living off the meager clout still achievable in horse fame.

It was too many people who were there just to feel something, to get excited about being part of something greater, and having no avenue for that besides ponies. A sort of repressed nerddom, all exploding out at once,
with no sense of perspective or self-awareness on what it meant in the grand scheme of things - absolutely nothing.
Ponies are cool, but I don't want them to be the only thing in my life.
I'm perfectly okay with
spending an irresponsible amount of time on MLP, as long as I know it's irresponsible.

Unfortunately, the people who don't know it's irresponsible, or who can't leave the MLP community
because all their friendships and community is based on MLP, are also the people who always, always
go to conventions. Horse conventions are their
churches. The places where, for one brief
weekend, the fandom *is* the real world, and as all-encompassing as people want it to be.

This is a subtle point, and I want to be very clear about it: I don't have a problem with people like
this existing. I think, on some level, every one of these rabid fandoms have some people who genuinely
didn't have any friends or community before discovering the fandom. There are tons of stories of
people who were depressed, or suicidal, who had reasonably high chances of taking their own life
before they found something to live for, in something as wonderfully goofy as My Little Pony.

I think it's clearly good that that happened.

I just don't want to talk with such people. Maybe that makes me stupid, or selfish. I don't know.

When your entire world is fandom, petty drama becomes a life-threatening attack. Bad episodes become
existential threats. Every time drama happens in the brony fandom (and there is *always* drama), I
wish I could force everyone involved to watch and understand "This is Phil Fish", a discussion
on Internet fame (or more specifically, what it's like to be a media object defined by people hating
you).

Towards the end of 2019, I was planning to move on from My Little Pony. It was getting smaller,
I'd seen what conventions had to offer, I had some merch to remember it by. What else was there to do?


One Last Ride
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BronyCon was **the** largest My Little Pony convention. Starting from small meetups in the New York City
area, it later moved to New Jersey, then Baltimore, reaching 10,000 attendees by 2015.

I say was, because BronyCon 2019 was the last BronyCon. There were a few factors going into it. Attendance
was declining about 20% year-over-year since the peak in 2015. Friendship is Magic's final season was
slated for 2019, and since being the biggest con was part of BronyCon's identity, organizing staff
decided they would rather end BronyCon with one big finale coinciding with the last season, rather
than carrying on and watching it grow smaller each year.

Given that there are other MLP conventions, which announced they had no intention of stopping, I thought
it was a good call. I had never gone to BronyCon, since I could never justify the travel cost, but
come on, it's the last one. If there's one to go to, it's that.

Evidently, others had the same idea. In 2018, they got 5,465 attendees. Knowing it was the last BronyCon,
organizers expected a bump to around 7,000 or 8,000. They got 10,000 again. All sorts of people turned out.
Lauren Faust, who had
moved on from the show after Season 2. Old fandom members, who got super into it, then stopped making
content in 2014, coming back for 1 weekend because it felt right. New fans who started just 1 or 2 years
ago, well after the hype had faded. There were all sorts of international people, which is true
every year, but this time, everyone had an excuse to splurge on the more expensive flights.

It. Was. *Nuts.*

I felt the fandom had told itself a collective story: the show's ending. People's lives are moving on.
There will always be a core group of fans, like the Trekkies, but that'll be it. It didn't feel like the
fandom was capable of pulling of conventions like BronyCon 2019 anymore, and the entire weekend was about
proving that wrong.

There was no way this was going to last. I think most people knew that it was only so big because of FOMO.
Still, that didn't make it any less entertaining. At the vendor hall, I talked to one of the few Asians
I saw, snagging the literal last Kirin shirt they had available in black. It was a little short, and I
heavily suspected it'd be too small for me after going through the wash, but there wasn't any choice. They
had run out on the first day.

![Kirin](/public/why-mlp/kirin.jpg)
{: .centered }

They had a panel about the South East Asia brony scene, which I said I'd check out, and then didn't. Oops.
Its mostly centered in the United States, but the fandom is definitely international.

I did talk to another Asian brony in the games room, while watching a *Them's Fightin' Herds*
tournament match. While people in the background were yelling about a game they obviously didn't
understand, he talked to me about the Chinese brony scene. A lot of the Chinese fanbase is younger, like
10 years or fewer, but they still pulled in around 1200 attendees at their most recent convention. He was
from Shenzhen, and was part of a group of 30 that made it past the visa issues. He was spending his time
getting merch to bring back for everyone who wasn't able to make it. I suspected he was from a rich
family, since he was only 18 and lived in Shenzhen, yet he had gotten a sponsor tier badge ($250+, guarantees shorter lines and other perks), was carrying around a really high quality Starlight plushie (which he said cost $530 to commission), and he offered me $50 if I'd stand in line to get Lauren Faust's autograph. Given that said line
was 4 hours long because everyone wanted to tell Lauren Faust their life story, I declined.

Of course, the convention center was getting used by other events too. That year, it was colocated with
the [Rubik's Cube National Championships](https://www.cubingusa.org/nationals/2019). I saw some cubers
walking through the same halls, and can only imagine what they were thinking when passing by the occasional
fursuit.

I went to one of the nighttime 18+ panels about the history of pony conventions, got a
pony-themed cocktail, and listened to a bunch of organizers talk about how they got here, and all
the horror stories of past cons. The one with the fire, the one where the organizers ran out of
money and were completely gone while shit was hitting the fan...
(Cocktail was vodka, apple juice, triple sec, cranberry syrup, and small pieces of strawberry. Way,
way too sweet. Shouldn't have been surprised.)

A number of brony conventions run concert series where fan musicians can play their music to a crowd.
Sometimes they play remixes of songs from the show, but more frequently they play original music that wouldn't
be out of place at an indie EDM concert. Because pony is what brought people together, but it's not the reason
people stay.

Usually, these events suck. It's a bunch of awkward people, in a room that's far too big, where no one's brave
enough to dance. The one at the final BronyCon? The Last Ride? It was *lit*. Okay, well, not by the standard
of a real nightclub or music concert. Still, it was packed at 2 AM. Someone was waving an enormous Equestria
flag. A person starts an impromptu conga line, yelling "JOIN US! IT'S OKAY! We're all retarded." Someone
else signals everyone to make room so that he can show off his sick breakdance moves.
Between the insane circumstances, and the casual self-directed use of "retard" in the year 2019, I'm
not sure I could give a better summary of the state of the fandom.

Despite everything, the rise and the fall in popularity, the content creators who moved on and see
their pony work as an old shame, the outing of community figureheads as racists or sexual abusers,
I can still see the happiness. Enough that although I wouldn't call myself a brony,
if someone did, I wouldn't feel the need to correct them. It'd be too hard to explain.


"Sometimes We're Self-Conscious About Our Dumb Sport"
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I don't have any plans to go to another con. None of them are going to top BronyCon anyways.

I probably won't watch any of Generation 5 either. I'm just not feeling much motivation to do so.

And, I'm not sure how much longer I'll stay in the fandom. The points of rides is to stop. It's okay
for them to stop. Or, at least, it's okay for me to get off it if I want to. I think that'll happen
one day. For now, I still get something out of listening to new songs from the pony music community,
and fan art pushes the right buttons.

I have spent an irrational amount of time and money on My Little Pony paraphernalia, and there is
only one thing I regret. I was wandering the vendor tables, and saw someone
was selling Arduineighs - a pony-themed Arduino clone. They
were themed after Twilight Sparkle's Secret Shipfic Folder, a PG rated board game making fun of
tropes in shipping fanfiction.

![Arduineigh](/public/why-mlp/tsssf.jpg)
{: .centered }

I bought one, and regretted it almost immediately. I had no plans to build off the board, and the
coolness of the plain metallic look wore off pretty quickly.

Everything else? No regrets. I don't regret the plushies, the prints, the shadow box, the
badge of Flurry Heart labeled "DEMON BABY" that I bought from a teenager who offered 10% off if
I subbed to Pewdiepie on YouTube. (I didn't.)

I come back to this question of what MLP all meant to me, and I've decided that's just the wrong
question to ask.
Pony fandom was a sizable part of my life for 10 years.
It wasn't separate from reality, it was an exaggeration of reality, at its worst and and its best.
The drama, the weirdos, the cool content creators, the jerk content creators, all of it.
My thoughts on it don't fit in a nice tidy box, because life doesn't fit in a nice tidy box.

In the late 2000s, there was a Youtuber named ChaosAngel. He uploaded metal remixes of Touhou songs,
from prog rock to black metal, and his work was pretty influential on my music tastes growing up.
His channel was hit with copyright strikes and taken down without appeal.
In response, he created a new channel, replaced the offending songs, and reuploaded the
rest. To announce the channel, he uploaded a ["song 0"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un8y1IbbMno) - a remix of Mima's theme Reincarnation.

> What were the reasons of the evil spirit Mima for her wish to destroy humankind, and why she goes from light to darkness was never known. Mima always denied her death, and she claims to be just a wandering spirit instead of a ghost, while she found the way to revive herself.
>
> So let us continue what she couldn't accomplish, by reviving ourselves.
>
> Thanks for watching.
>
> "No one shall be able to drive us from the wonderland that ZUN created for us."

Sure, Hasbro's the ones who created Wonderland, but its fans that make it a place worth visiting.
Together we've created bizarre cathedrals of horses and magic and cringeworthy stained glass windows,
and it needs someone to bear witness.
As long as people maintain it, I'll check in from time to time, even if it's only out of nostalgia.
Even if it's all fake compared to the real world, the cathedrals were important to us.

I've found parallels in the MMA documentary
["Fighting in the Age of Loneliness"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DoaUyMGPWI) by Felix Biederman and Jon Bois,
and the baseball documentary ["The History of the Seattle Mariners"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIgK56cAjfY) by Jon Bois and Alex Rubenstein. Both are long and meandering, but among their stories are good gems on
what it means to be a fan.

I've long given up on getting anyone else into this fandom, this thing where observing it is harder than pretending
it doesn't exist. That's fine.
They don't have to see it or understand it. They just have to accept it.
If they can't, they can go to hell.

Over time, I've come around to the "relentless march of the normal" theory. Any culture that gets
big - any culture *at all* - either grows big enough to lose its unique charm and become another
building block in the background, or stays small enough to protect itself from everything else.
We all wish we could get both the charm and the popularity. I've yet to see anything succeed.
All those early brony thinkpieces examining why people don't watch the show were a waste of time.
If they had succeeded, we wouldn't recognize what came out. Sometimes it's worth fighting for
legitimacy, but bronies lost that fight ages ago.
Make fun of yourself by saying your trash, and move on.

BronyCon was lucky, that their final run was the year before COVID-19 swept through and cancelled
all pony conventions for 2020. It was really unclear how the brony ecosystem would fare. Cons
had to strike deals with hotels, and artists who rely on con sales as supplementary income were
in trouble. In response,
some organizers set up [PonyFest](https://ponyfest.horse/), a free online brony convention with
remote panels and a vendor hall hosted in Discord. I checked out the music concert hosted in
[Pony Town](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NpEgOXZoTQ), a social MMORPG where people can make
pony OCs to hang out, and when I counted how many people were online, I realized this fandom
actually might never die. Where are these people even coming from?

Sure, Generation 4 is over, but there's always going to be this core group of hardcore
fans that have transcended the show, doing what makes them happy. The recursive engine of
fan art of fan art is going to keep spinning. The Generation 5 movie kick started things a little bit.
Maybe the TV series will be good. Maybe it won't. It doesn't matter either way.
Once you're in, a part of you never leaves.
