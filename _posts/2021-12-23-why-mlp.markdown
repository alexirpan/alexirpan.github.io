I've really put off writing this post.

I've been watching My Little Pony for literally 10 years. **10 years.** Good lord, that's
a long time. I thought I would leave the fandom in 2019, after the Friendship is Magic series
finale. Then
I thought I would stop watching in 2020. Then I thought I would stop in 2021...and here I am.

I've known for a long time that I wanted to write something about what My Little Pony means
to me, but I've put it off for a long time because it brings up a complicated group of emotions and
ideas that are hard to explain. At the same time, I knew I had to write this post. So let's get
started.


How Did I Get Into My Little Pony?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Just so we're clear, I'm not trying to get anybody into the show with this post. I decided long ago
that it wasn't worth doing so. But, I can't explain what the My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic
fandom means to me if I don't explain its appeal.

Like a lot of bronies, I started around 2011, in the hiatus between Season 1 and 2. I was
a high school student attending Canada/USA Mathcamp that summer.
Mathcamp is a summer math program that introduces talented high school students to interesting
university level maths, like topology or complexity theory. One thing special about Mathcamp is that
it encourages student-organized events. As long as you get enough staff to agree to supervise,
students can organize anything they want. The brony phenemenon was in full swing, a few students were fans,
some *staff* were fans, and they organized a watch party. I went, watched a few episodes, saw the appeal,
and resolved to catch up on the season later.

Not everyone who went got it. I distinctly remember one staff who wanted to give the show a chance,
but was competely baffled why it was popular after watching a few episodes. We had just finished
"Cal of the Cutie", so we all called him a blank flank, which just sparked more confusion.
Good times.

Season 2 started out really strong, and I stuck with the show all the way until its finale in 2019.
Friendship is Magic has its ups
and downs, but at its core it's a wholesome, well-animated cartoon that shifts between light
low continuity slice of life episodes, and high fantasy adventures where the fate of the world is at
stake. The characters have fun personalities, they play off each other well, and then occasionally it
turns into a magical girl anime with big laser beam fights.
What's not to like?

Of course, people got mad or got the wrong idea. *No*, it's not about the 1980s Generation 1 cartoon,
it's almost exclusively about the Generation 4 Friendship is Magic one. *No*, it's not some fetish thing,
most of the fandom just likes the show. (There was some porn, because people are always horny, but it
wasn't a focal point.) *No*, it wasn't some elaborate gaslighting ironic joke. Maybe for some it was,
but people just genuninely liked the show.

There was other criticism too. "I can't believe you're watching a kid's show."
When people said this, I don't think they actually mean "shows made
for kids can't be objectively good." All of Pixar and Disney's best work is a clear counterexample.
Instead, I think they really mean that shows for kids can get away with worse writing because they can dazzle
with bright colors and flashy explosions, rather than interesting character conflicts or clever humor.


Before Friendship is Magic, I think most people thought My Little Pony was a trash-quality cartoon whose
success was thanks to pandering to little girls so that their parents would buy more toys. That's...probably
true. The few clips I've seen of previous generations have ranged from mediocre to incredibly awful.
Friendship is Magic was different. The show staff aimed to make a good cartoon first...so that kids would buy toys
from a popular cartoon. Yeah, it's an advertising vehicle for kids, but it's a fun advertising vehicle
for kids.

When people derisively refer to something as a "kid's show", I don't think they actually mean "shows made
for kids can't be objectively good." All of Pixar and Disney's best work should be a counterexample for that.
Instead, I think they really mean that shows for kids can get away with worse writing because they can dazzle
with bright colors and flashy explosions, rather than interesting character conflicts or clever humor.

Then again, during the Q&A for a show writer panel, I once asked if they ever felt tension between writing
for the intended demographic, and writing for the adult demographic. I forget who replied, but they said
they didn't really think about it at all. Humor is universal, whether it's for kids or grown-ass men,
and they just focused on writing well.

I wouldn't say they succeeded all the time. Episodes have *incredibly* varying quality. The stinkers are
really bad, but the good ones are *really* good. Seriously, I'm not sure how it works standalone, but
"The Perfect Pear"? *So good*.

Even so, this doesn't explain how the fandom got so big in the first place. I've heard it described
as a lightning in the bottle, and there's an element of truth to that. In 2006,
Salganik, Dodds, and Watts published sociology research on [Music Lab](http://www.princeton.edu/~mjs3/musiclab.shtml),
an artificial music platform where participants could rank songs and observe other people's rankings
of songs. They wanted to study why success was so hard to predict in the entertainment industry. The
[paper](http://www.princeton.edu/~mjs3/salganik_dodds_watts06_full.pdf)'s pretty interesting, but
the short version is that song popularity is unpredictable because it's genuinely unpredictable.
Across different trials, song rankings would change wildly, with stronger inequality the more
participants got to observe other people's opinions. Based on the data, I'd conclude that
quality of a work drives how popularity grows, but social factors ("what are
my friends listening to?") are required to kick-start the userbase. I assume these dynamics are even
stronger now compared to 2006, given a bigger Internet and stronger recommendation systems.

In most realities, My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic never attracts a large audience. It's a
quietly successful cartoon, sells a bunch of toys, and otherwise leaves no mark on pop culture.
In our reality, it didn't. After winning the cosmic lottery, the premise was too novel to ignore.
Not the premise of the show: the premise of the *fandom*.
"Several 15 to 30 year old men swear up and down that the new My Little Pony
show is worth watching" was a bizarre enough idea to overpower many existing aversions.
The only reason I gave MLP a chance was because
I was into Homestuck at the time, and MLP profile pics and references were appearing on the MSPA
forums.

Lauren Faust moved on from the show after Season 2, but she came back to do a panel for the last BronyCon.
In the Q&A section, she and a writer (M. A. Larson) talked about
the moment
they knew the brony fandom was for real - [the day they watched a bunch of Russian teenagers](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/cezmyc/yo_reddit_im_ma_larson_writer_on_my_little_pony/eu688z7/?context=8&depth=9) singing
along to *Winter Wrap-Up*.

"Fans are Great. Fandom is Weird"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Of course there were haters. Every culture creates its counterculture and bronies are no different.
Even so, bronies got it especially bad. If you hate 4chan, you could beat them down by association. If you hate furries,
there's some overlap and it's easy to redirect that outrage.

Unpopular opinion ahead: the MLP fandom *totally* deserved it. Sure, a lot of the insults were
never factually correct, but you know the old saying: "Fans are great. Fandom is weird." (Supposedly
this was said by Terry Pratchett, but I've never found a clear source.) I've yet to see any fandom
that wasn't weird in one way or another. And, look, I mean this in the least judgmental way
possible, but I've been in Touhou. I've been in Homestuck. Let's say
I have a *pretty calibrated* sense of how weird fandoms can be, and MLP fandom is **weird**. That's
why I love it.

What do I even mean by "weird"? Roughly, I define weirdness by how much effort you need to explain it to
a cultural outsider. The harder it is to explain, the weirder it is. Cosplay? Not that weird. People
do it all the time, it's like Halloween costumes. Cosplaying in a fursuit? Well, now that's weirder.
Fan of LeBron James? Not weird. If anything, people might call you basic.
Fan of [Lee "Flash" Young-ho](https://liquipedia.net/starcraft2/Flash)? Well, if you're talking to
the average person, you're going to need to unpack that a bit.

Things like "brohoof" or saying "welcome to the herd" are just clearly weird. Making up entire
backstories for ponies that appear in the background of a single episode is super weird. Putting out
endless remixes of a 2 minute showtune is just an odd thing to do. They don't have good explanations,
besides "everyone else was doing it" - which isn't a good explanation at all. And although
their origins are tied to the show, they mostly came from the fans surrounding the show, expressing
their passion in one way or another.

I've come to realize that I put a lot of respect on people who take a nonsense idea, with minimal
usefulness to the real world, and just run with it to completion because they want to. There's too
many people who drop things at the first signs of resistance, and I'd rather live in a world where people follow
through.

Fandom in general is driven most by untapped potential. If someone creates an amazing world, and
tells an incomplete story, you bet people are going to write better ones in the same world. In this
respect, Friendship is Magic was almost hyperoptimized for fandom.
When Hasbro wants to make a new toy line,
the writers have to write it into the show, whether they want to or not. No confirmations anywhere,
but there's a rumor that Season 3's finale was so rushed because the writers couldn't get
executives to sign off on a 2-part episode. Sometimes, the writers just drop the ball and put out
a bad episode. And since it has to stay family-friendly, there's inherent constraints on what the
show staff is allowed to do.

(Storyboard of Twilight v Tirek fight, before edits.)
{: .centered }

In addition, the ensemble cast made it easy for
fans to find some character they found compelling, and the show has a nasty habit of hinting at the
broader lore and world of Equestria without ever explaining it because it doesn't serve the plot.
There's untapped potential everywhere in Friendship is Magic, and you couldn't ask for a better sandbox to
play in.

And fans did play in it.
Looking back,
I still think the editing on [Ponycraft 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJbAT1wzS8U),
[Shingeki no Pony](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sj4yJ4MPYA), and
[The Stars Will Aid in Her Escape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdhSb-L3hf8) is all
really well done. For the last one in particular, it's open to interpretation, but it's interesting to
realize that in a fight between the day and night, a character named Twilight was the one who
brought peace.

In some ways, I feel fan content can be better than original content.
Fanwork is like painting a tapestry, but instead of the standard
colors like red and blue, you get more exotic colors like Reimu or Papyrus. That's inherently
more limiting, but if you understand the references, that fan work can convey very specific
feelings or ideas that would be much harder from purely original work.

There was just so much content, and although Sturgeon's Law still applies, MLP fandom was prolific
enough that you could usually find something good.
Make a voice-acted 9 hour [Ace Attorney x MLP crossover video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUDfoZGhLjE)?
Sure, why not. *Turnabout Storm* is slow at times, but it does a great job at capturing the tone of
Ace Attorney, and the case's resolution is excellent. Similarly, when I reread
[Fallout Equestria](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/119190/fallout-equestria), a 620k word
Fallout x MLP fanfic, I felt it still held up as a case study in how to write a protagonist who
uses their abilities to their full potential.

*Why?* Why does any of this exist? Because people wanted to make it. Perhaps it's silly that fans
ascribed so much meaning to an IP that could carry on without them, but in this world, anything that lets
people find meaning is good.

I think this is most exemplified by
[Lullaby for a Princess](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7PQ9IO-7fU), an animation by WarpOut.

The song is from another fan artist, ponyphonic. WarpOut got inspired by the song, and decided to animate
it. It took them 2.5 years to finish a 7 minute animation, because for some reason they wanted to go all out
on the quality. The animation's all handmade. The backgrounds are watercolor - as in, some of them are
watercolor on physical paper. The meat and potatoes of animating was done by one person, averaging 0.5
seconds of footage per day.

(Another GIF here)

The deeper you go, the more examples you can find of fans building off other fans. Fallout Equestria
has not one, but [two](https://absolutelyeverything.org/) different [print](https://www.ministryofimage.net/)
projects (the latter with a wider selection of MLP fiction, if you're willing to stomach the shipping cost
from Russia).

Much of my interaction with the fandom now is just through the pony brony music scene (which yes, is a thing).
You've got [Ponies at Dawn](https://poniesatdawn.bandcamp.com/) as the
"big" label, but then there are smaller labels like [Equinity](https://equinity.bandcamp.com/) and
new labels like [VibePoniez](https://vibeponiez.bandcamp.com/) curating more lofi music. Which all feeds into
sites like the [Equestrian Trot 100](http://trot100.blogspot.com/) (now deprecated), or [Horse Music Herald](https://horsemusicherald.com/)
which shares new releases.

https://xkcd.com/1095/

These songs get a few thousand views. The launch parties get around 100 to 200 listeners. Nothing too crazy,
but good enough for people to keep tuning in. Sometimes you have to animate something. Sometimes you have
to write a song. That's how creative work goes. If My Little Pony is the way to push over the activation
energy? Screw it, why not. On Hold by YourEnigma slaps. The acoustic cover of it by the Wasteland
Wailers' is a banger. It's the same thing as "real" [acoustic remixes of rap songs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8pbCtJjuqo), localized entirely within
the pony fandom. Who are we to say that doesn't make it real?

*Fighting is Magic* was a 2D fighting game made by a group of fans who knew what they were doing, making
enough progress to show it off at side events for Evo, one of the biggest fighting game tournaments in the
world. They were hit with a cease and desist letter from Hasbro, renamed to *Them's Fightin' Herds*, redid
all their work with new IP in a new engine, and successfully released after an Indiegogo campaign, 6 years after
their first build. The game still receives updates today, and its existence is a bit of a miracle.

> I dunno how familiar people are with fan projects, but there are probably hundreds of ideas for fan projects starting every day. I would say 99% of them never go beyond the idea phase. It’s exceedingly unlikely that any given fan project will go anywhere at all, let alone stick together for as long as we have. Of the ones that do get past the idea phase, most of them are filled with passion, but are lacking skills. [...] The tiny team we started with, from a random collection of people who happened to see a single post on a single forum at a certain time happened to get along and have the drive and skills that complemented each other and most of the gaps were filled right off the bat.

There was a certain energy in the fandom at that time, where people felt empowered to make whatever
they wanted, along with an assuredness worn by fans who knew the community would keep growing and
last forever. And like every group in history, they were wrong.

"Our Cabinet's Fractured Into Factions"
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Compared to what it was in the early years, the brony fandom's a shell of what it was. The golden age
is over and what's left is much less definable.

You could try to blame it on Season 3. Controversial at the time, and still near the bottom of
"best season" polls. You could blame it on the shifts in the show's tone. As the show evolved, it
"grew up", making more nods to the adult audience, which not everybody liked.

https://www.equestriadaily.com/2018/12/poll-results-what-is-best-season-of-my.html

I think it's more like what happend with Pokemon Go. For a short time, the world collectively
had a fever dream and got in on the hype, and when the cracks emerged, the world moved on.
The people left are the ones who didn't.

I've thought about leaving the fandom many times. Hell, even up to around 2018, I wasn't sure if I'd
call myself a brony, even though by that point I'd gone to a brony convention, had read about 2 million
words of fanfic, and created a custom Dominion expansion that I tried to get into Equestria Daily.
I always preferred calling myself an "MLP fan" or "member of the fandom", because I wasn't sure I wanted
everything the "brony" label is associated with. The best explanation I've found is from [Research is Magic](https://web.archive.org/web/20150120223532/http://www.researchismagic.org/2014/04/what-sort-of-group-are-bronies/#more-520),
a now-defunct blog by an ethnographer working on their PhD thesis. (Ethnography is the study of a culture
from the point of view of people within that culture.)

> In my dissertation research, I study people who self-identify as Vietnamese and how they form connections with one another in local communities, on national and continental levels, and even transnationally. I’ve purposefully avoided categories like “Vietnamese Americans” or “the Vietnamese diaspora” because they tend to presuppose certain sorts of relationships that people may or may not have with each other [...]. Therefore, I have often used terminology like ‘self-identify as Vietnamese” because the identification of oneself as Vietnamese means that a person is self-consciously engaged in **identity work** of a sort that produces potential links to other people who also self-identify as Vietnamese.
>
> [...]
>
> Kurt and I say often, “I’m not sure I’m a brony,” and we have both wondered about what keeps either of us from taking the plunge, so to speak. I would venture a guess that our anxiety stems from an incongruity between the moment we started to construct for ourselves an idea of a brony community and its relationship to our other affiliations. For me at least, I had been a casual viewer of the show for a long time. Even once I heard that bronies were a thing, I did not feel a need to reevaluate my watching of the show in those terms. I was part of the public/counterpublic in the sense we began with—of a kind of rapt attention to a cultural object—but since there was no utility for me in identifying with others, I felt no need to do the associated identity work.
>
> Once Kurt and I decided we were going to do research on bronies, then the community became a “thing” for us…but it also meant that we at that same moment already had identities vis-a-vis that thing: brony **researchers**. Having produced the relationship with the fandom as one of a scholarly gaze, it’s been difficult to take on the brony label, even though we’re often doing exactly the same thing bronies are. The way the imagined community is imagined, the moment at which it is imagined, and a person’s relationship to that imagined thing all become important considerations.

When I went through the feedback for [My Little Pony: Puzzles are Magic](https://www.puzzlesaremagic.com/), I saw all kinds
of responses along these lines. A person said they've seen every MLP episode, but don't consider themselves a brony. A BABSCon
attendee (Bay Area Brony Spectacular) said they were 2 seasons behind. A couple said they and their partner called each other
Flutter Butter and Dashie, but they didn't consider themselves bronies.

As much as I've consumed MLP content (both canon and fanon), I never really found the sense of fellowship that so many people said
they found in the fandom. To me, it was something fun to watch, but I didn't feel the need to go to bat for a generic
imagined brony, nor did I feel like I'd get anything if I did call myself a brony. So I didn't.

There are parts of brony fandom that I stay away from. It's impossible to talk about bronies without
talking about 4chan, and in my
entire time on the Internet, 4chan's always been known as a cesspool. I'm sure the 4chan users would
agree. If you want a deep dive on 4chan culture, I
quite liked [Dale Beran's](https://medium.com/@DaleBeran/4chan-the-skeleton-key-to-the-rise-of-trump-624e7cb798cb)
essay, written shortly after Trump won the 2016 election.

What does this have to do with My Little Pony? Well, according to legend, the brony fandom
grew out of /co/, 4chan's board about comics and cartoons. An anon shared [an article](https://web.archive.org/web/20101207135530/https://www.cartoonbrew.com/ideas-commentary/the-end-of-the-creator-driven-era.html)
titled "The End of the Creator-Driven Era in TV Animation". It mentions that Lauren Faust
(showrunner for popular cartoons like *Powerpuff Girls* and *Foster's Home for Imaginary Fans*)
is leading a My Little Pony reboot, and this is signalling the end of true creative expression
in animation as an art form. The future of animation is corporate suits pushing out bland products.
It get some traction in /co/, and a few decide to hate-watch MLP. Get some free Internet points
by shitting on trash.

They get a few episodes in and realize, with dawning horror, that they're liking it on a non-ironic
level.

It spreads quickly. MLP simultaneously becomes a way to troll non-fans (hijack threads with pony pictures)
and fans (here's porn of MLP characters, oh it disgusts you, I guess you aren't a true fan). The mods make
a /mlp/ containment board to stop the pollution of serious and dignified cartoon discussion, it leaks
out of 4chan to the wider world, and you know the rest.

> In Bukowski’s novel **Factotum**, the main character, Hank Chinaski, drifts through various demeaning blue-collar jobs until he ends up working the stockroom of an autoparts store. The job is no better than any of the others, except for one important difference: It ends early enough for Chinaski and another worker, Manny, to race to the track for the last bet of the day. Soon the other workers in the warehouse hear of the scheme and ask Hank to put down their bets, too.
>
> At first Hank objects. He doesn’t have time to make their petty bets before the track closes. But Manny has a different idea.

> Soon Chinaski and Manny are flush with money, not from working for the $1.25 an hour at the warehouse or even making smart bets themselves, but from taking the money of the other workers and not betting it. That is, after all, why those same men handing over their bets work in the factory; they are defined by their bad decisions, by the capacity for always getting a bad deal.

>
> These Trump supporters hold a different sort of ideology, not one of “when will my horse come in”, but a trolling self-effacing, “I know my horse will never come in”. That is to say, younger Trump supporters know they are handing their money to someone who will never place their bets — only his own — because, after all, it’s plain as day there was never any other option.

(Just in case a 4channer runs across this - yes, I know that /pol/ is not all of 4chan, not
everyone on 4chan is part of the alt-right, and parts can be surprisingly civil, but let's be honest.
Is "I'm on the good parts of 4chan" really a good defense?)

4chan's the home of (mostly) men, whose hopelessness runs so deep they can't find solace anywhere else.
Shock humor rules the day, and community there is powered by rapidly making new memes, calling everyone
who doesn't get it "normies", then immediately moving to a new one to try to feel special in a world that
thinks they aren't.

As the brony fandom cooled down, a lot of the reasonable people evaporated away,
and the people left are either my people, weird in the same ways I am, and people I never want to interact
with in my life. I feel it's similar to my relations with Bay Area rationalists. There was a moment in time
where the "brony" label felt like it symbolized something cohesive in my mind, and now it means many different
things. The subcultures nest infinitely and not all the branches like each other.

I suspect it was always like this. Most MLP fans are aggressively liberal,
proud Black Lives Matters supporters, and often LGBTQ themselves, but its 4chan roots means there's
always that fraction of Blue Lives Matter supporters who
argue My Little Pony supports the white supremicist belief that the world would be better if
different races lived segregated from one another.
(Or, you have the faction who belives their right to make edgy "master race" jokes is okay, even if
it provides cover for real racists.)
It shouldn't be surprising that people from opposite sides of the political spectrum
can both enjoy a show. Parasite has been read as both [a critique of the current class system](https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/9/13/20864365/parasite-review-bong-joon-ho) and [a cautionary tale for the rich to choose their
employees well](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2020/06/the-gaslighting-of-parasite.html).
But success, growth, and excitement has a way of masking over these problems. It's only in the decline
that people notice what's wrong.

As I spent more time in these convention spaces, I started to see the dreary plain white conference room walls instead of fans. I did quick headcounts at panels and saw it was
low. Content creators whose work I respected just acting like total assholes in person, living
off the meager clout still achievable in horse fame.
It felt
like too many people were there just to feel something, to get excited about being part of something greater, even if that something greater was ponies. In some downtime at the last BronyCon, I sat in the games room,
watching a match from the *Them's Fightin' Herds* tournament. One person there was yelling and getting
hype about everything, and it was quickly clear he didn't know anything about the game. He just wanted
something to yell about.

At BABSCon, one of the Q&A panel questions was, "If you could ship Twilight Sparkle with any pre-2000
US President, which would you pick?" Every year, BABSCon runs a charity auction and they take items from anyone.
Sometimes it's good stuff and sometimes it's stuff like an empty box of Froot Loops.

![Toucan Sam](/public/why-mlp/toucan.jpg)
{: .centered }

Or a bunch of Tide pods with a dabbing Ugandan Knuckes, back when that was a thing.

![Tide pods and Knuckes](/public/why-mlp/knuckles.jpg)
{: .centered }

Or someone doing a live rendition of "We Are Number One" in Robbie Rotten cosplay, which I always regret
not saving.

You know if this type of humor works for you. For me it does! Still, I don't want memes to be my
entire personality. Doing it too much is to fall into the 4chan trap of keeping up with everything
not because you want to, but because you need to in order to fit in.
Fandom is about keeping up with memes on some level and I don't want fandom to be the only thing in
my life.
I'm perfectly okay with
spending an irresponsible amount of time on MLP, as long as I know it's irresponsible. Some people
don't.

Unfortunately, those people are the ones that always go to cons, the places where,
for a brief weekend, the fandom *is* the real world and as all-encompassing as people want it to be.
When your entire world is fandom, petty drama becomes a life-threatening attack, bad episodes become
existential threats, and things get blown up more important than they should be.
Every time drama happens
in the brony fandom (and there is *always* drama), I
wish I could force everyone involved to watch and understand "This is Phil Fish".

Maybe more people get this than I think. If they do, they sure don't make it obvious.


"Sometimes We're Self-Conscious About Our Dumb Sport"
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The brony fandom's cheated me out of $5.

I was wandering the vendor hall, on a dark and stormy night. (Well, okay, it was a bright and
sunny April afternoon.) Someone was selling Arduineighs - a pony-themed Arduino clone. Except, they
were *also* themed after Twilight Sparkle's Secret Shipfic Folder, a PG rated board game making fun of
tropes in shipping fanfiction.

![Arduineigh](/public/why-mlp/tsssf.jpg)
{: .centered }

I bought one, and regretted it about an hour later. I wasn't planning to mess with the board, and
the coolness of the plain metallic look wore off for me pretty quickly in favor of the original colored
art.

Everything else? No regrets. I don't regret the plushies, the prints, or the laser-cut wood. I don't
regret the badge of Flurry Heart labeled "DEMON BABY", bought from a teenager who offered 10% off if
I subbed to Pewdiepie. (I didn't.)

Despite everything, the rise and the fall in popularity, the content creators who moved on and see
their pony work as an old shame, the outing of community figureheads as racists or sexual abusers,
I still feel some sense of connection to the fandom. Enough that although I wouldn't call myself a brony,
if someone did, I wouldn't feel the need the correct them.

In the late 2000s, there was a Youtuber named ChaosAngel, who uploaded metal remixes of Touhou songs
from doujin circles at the time. The Touhou music is without question the largest fan music in the
world, and he uploaded remixes from all sorts of doujin circles, from prog rock to black metal, a sort
of "best of the best".

His channel was hit with copyright strikes and taken down without appeal.

In response, he created a new channel, replacing the offending videos, and reuploading all songs
posted before. To announce the channel, he uploaded a ["song 0"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un8y1IbbMno) - a remix of Reincarnation, a song whose original was from 1997 (thirteen years old then, and twenty four
years old now.) He had this to say.

> What were the reasons of the evil spirit Mima for her wish to destroy humankind, and why she goes from light to darkness was never known. Mima always denied her death, and she claims to be just a wandering spirit instead of a ghost, while she found the way to revive herself.
>
> So let us continue what she couldn't accomplish, by reviving ourselves.
>
> Thanks for watching.
>
> "No one shall be able to drive us from the wonderland that ZUN created for us."

I suspect the power doesn't come through, unless you there at the time.

I'm still in the pony fandom because it's cool. I still get something out of it. I'm here because other
people who also get something out of it are still here. Sure, Hasbro's the ones who created Wonderland, but
we're the ones who made it a place worth visting. Together we've created a bizarre cathedral of horses
and magic that needs someone to bear witness.

I've found parallels in an unlikely source: MMA.
"Fighting in the Age of Loneliness" is a documentary about the history of fighting, narrated by
Felix Biederman, a podcaster for the very leftist podcast [Chapo Trap House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapo_Trap_House). It's long and meandering, but it's a good story about why Felix felt MMA had
hollowed out and lost the magic that captivated him before.

I've long given up on getting anyone else into pony fandom, this entity strange enough that observing
it is harder than pretending it doesn't exist. I've quietly accepted that almost none of my friends would
call themselves bronies, and that's fine. This doesn't have to be a thing that people understand.
It just has to be something they accept. If they can't, they can go to hell.

Over time, I've come around to the "relentless march of the normal" theory. Any culture that gets
big - any culture *at all* - gets two choices. One: maintain popularity by appealing to a wide
swatch of people. Sand off all the pointy edges that appeal to one person while alienating another.
Lose your unique charm, and become another building block in the background. Or two: accept that
the world will never be ready for you. Watch it shrink in size, and congeal into its own, funnily
shaped thing. We all wish we could get both the charm and the popularity. I've yet to see anything
succeed at doing so. All those early brony thinkpieces examining why people don't watch the show,
scheming ways to get more people into pony? Useless. Dust in the wind. If they had succeeded,
we wouldn't recognize what came out. It's not worth fighting for legitimacy, so accept
the standard cure - make fun of yourself by calling yourself trash, and move on.

The brony fandom isn't separate from reality. It's more like an exaggeration of reality.
The drama, the weirdos, the cool content creators, the jerk content creators, all circling pony,
all equally inextricable, and at the end of the day we acknowledge it's its own world and go
back to something more tangible. Even if it was fake, the cathedrals were important to us.

I spent much of my free time in 2019 working on a [My Little Pony themed puzzlehunt](https://www.puzzlesaremagic.com/). It was around
340 hours of work, took up much of my daydreaming time, and ruined my ability to make small
talk with anyone. It stressed me out, cost me sleep, and by the end I was down about $100
in server costs with no expectation of getting any of that money back.

Why? I had to. I knew I wouldn't be happy with myself until I did.

Once upon a time, I knew someone working on a book. They observed that when they said this
to non-authors, they'd say "Congrats, good luck!" Whereas when they talked to already-published
authors, they'd say "Oh no, I'm so sorry, how's it going?"

In mid-2020, the world was in the depths of the COVID-19 pandemic. With all pony conventions for the year
cancelled or postponed, and no new main-line episodes coming, it was unclear whether the fandom would
last. More practically, the artists who relied on sales at cons were in trouble as well. In response,
some organizers set up [PonyFest](https://ponyfest.horse/), a free online brony convention that aimed to
match the in-person experience as much as possible. Part of it was a music concert hosted in
[Pony Town](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NpEgOXZoTQ), a social MMORPG. People turned up *hard*.

![Ponyfest](/public/why-mlp/ponyfest.png)

It was at that moment that I realized something: this fandom is never going to die. Sure, Generation
4 is over, but there's always going to be this core group of hardcore
fans that have transcended the show, doing what makes them happy. The recursive engine of
fan art of fan art is going to keep spinning. Maybe Generation 5 will kick start things, maybe it won't.
Maybe I'll stick around, or maybe it'll get old. Who's to say? I have little interest in attending
future brony conventions (I'd rather preserve the memories of the last BronyCon), but never say never.

I watched the 6-part Seattle Mariners documentary by Secret Base. Despite having
no interest in baseball, I got drawn into the story of the Mariners, a team that has hit the highest highs (most wins
in a Major League Baseball seasons), and the lowest lows (only team to never play in a World Series, longest
active playoff drought). They're often called the most tragic team in baseball. Yet despite this, they have fans, legends,
and heroes.

Things to cover:

* mandarinorange PMVs / SimGretina, people leaving the community out of shame or bad feelings, pony archive project.
    * mandarin yes, SimGretina no
* "hey follow my new work"
* Tension between people creating overt pony references and pony inspired work.

Things I want to work up to:

A lot of brony conventions run BronyPalooza, a concert series where musicians in the fandom play music. Usually,
they don't even play showtunes. At best they play songs that have MLP inspiration, but which wouldn't be out
of place on a generic indie music album. Because pony is what brought people together, but it's not the reason
everyone stays.

Usually, these events suck. You get a bunch of awkward dancers, in a room that's far too big, and no one's brave
enough to dance. The BronyPalooza at the last BronyCon? The Last Ride? It was *lit*. It was packed at 2 AM, and if
it weren't for the MLP visuals and person waving a full size Equestrian flag, it wouldn't be out of place from
a run-of-the-mill nightclub.

Behind me is an impromptu conga line, and the person at the end of it yells "Come on, JOIN US! IT'S OKAY! We're
all retarded." Between the insane circumstances, and the casual self-directed use of "retard" in the year 2019, I'm
not sure I could give a better summary of the MLP community.

\* \* \*

Extremism tends to attract extremism. Not because they seek each other, but because by definition, the extremists have
a hard time in normal social circles. There is a reason some people use "normies" as a slur, and if all the low-openness
people get weirded out, only the weird ones are left - and yes, that sometimes means Black Lives Matters and Blue Lives
Matters folk live under the same umbrella of MLP fandom, each blissfully unaware of the others politics until things come
to a head.

I've seen it all. Aggressively nonbinary and transgender people finding solace in changelings (a race of shapeshifters)
and criticizing anyone to the right of Bernie Sanders.
People trying to defend an OC of white supremacy by saying "it's just an edgy joke", and then immediately lamenting that
the fandom has actual white supremecists (without realizing that sometimes it's not worth joking about some things).

Sure, a lot of us are a little self-conscious about our dumb fandom. But if people are going to make fun of us, we want
them to make fun of us for liking a show about ponies.

Equestria Daily does a reasonably frequent call-out of when other media references MLP or the brony subculture. They once
talked about (CHECK THIS) the Teen Titans Go! movie, where a brony was portrayed as an obese white man that was clearly
meant to be read as a loser. EQD's commentary was "at least we're still relevant enough to be made fun of".

I've thought about those words a lot. I feel I see echos of that everywhere. Felix (LAST NAME), talking about being an
MMA fan, and how they couldn't explain how the magic of the octagon gave disaffected men an arena where real heroics
and villainy could happen, outside the confines of a brutal corporation society. A Smash documentary, where a commentator
talks about how Melee locals are their churches, and a former pro talks about how they didn't find themselves in Smash, but
they found a second self in Smash. A documentary on Phil Fish, a notoriously controversial indie game developer, looking
at the reshare counts of an article he's in, saying "I don't know why I care so much".

I feel like everyone's looking for community, or meaning, or just *something*, *anything* that helps cure their
existentialism, and if that comes from horse conventions? Well, it's weird...but I'm not sure I can say it's bad. Fandom
is the engine that creates meaning, and more meaning seems better than none.

\* \* \*

You run into problems when you meet the people whose entire identity is wrapped up in a single subculture. That's how
you get people planning real-life power outages to disrupt an EVE Online clan. A person calling another a wanna-be
dictator for blocking people they don't like on Twitter. The infamous Steven Universe fandom incident. So on and so forth.
It would be easy to lay this at the feet of certain fandoms, but the problem is more of intensity rather than source
material, and intensity tends to wane over time. The crazy Homestuck fans moved to MLP, and then to Steven Universe,
and then to Undertale and then to Hazbin Hotel and then...well, I think I'm getting too old to spectate them anymore,
but I heard The Owl House is getting some buzz.

In some ways, I'm actually kinda happy the fandom slowed down. Sure, there's less content, and it's less fun watching
creators leave every year, but the people left are a bit older and more self-aware that none of this *actually* matters.
It was fun watching someone set up a "your waifu is trash, change my mind" table, or seeing the shrine of discarded
MLP toys grow larger and larger over the course of BronyCon, and watching the fandom get less acrimonious about
content creators moving on to other things.


Outline
--------------------------------------------------------------------


Things to cover:

* MLP fan music scene
    * done
* mandarinorange PMVs / SimGretina, people leaving the community out of shame or bad feelings, pony archive project.
    * mandarin yes, SimGretina no
* "hey follow my new work"
* Tension between people creating overt pony references and pony inspired work.
* "At least we're still relevant enough to be made fun of"
    * I think it's true but IDK but I have a good place to bring it up.
* The way in which peope took degeneracy / the disgust of others as a point of pride, that other
 people didn't "get it".
    * done
* The whole "join the herd" and the whoe cult-like obsessions (but the joke is that most people
are in the joke)
    * done / cutting?
* The occasional alt-right tendencies, and how this is most exaggerated at the conventions which
are the most concentrated form of people who don't fit into society (whether through neurodivergence,
not knowing how to relate to people, etc.)
    * done
* "Fandoms don't die, they just slow down"
* The shift from hipster-ism to just treating it as a normal thing.
    * not relevant to throughline of argument.
* Big fish in a small pond, vanity pond, fighting for clout, Phil Fish video.
    * done
* PonyTown, PonyFest concert.
* Fandom as a means of escapism from a cruel world (for people who don't find something in the world that gives them meaning, fan work can create its own meaning.)
    * done, sort of, via fighting for loneliness.
* Is Fandom good/bad? My sense is that it's at times distasteful and weird, but is less destructive than
other things - it is better than it meant something, even if it ended in pain, rather than not meaning
anything at all. As for whether one fandom is better or worse than another one, that depends on if you can
live with its ethos.
    * I don't think I'm even trying to defend whether fandom is good or bad? I'm mostly defending, why am I in this fandom, and if the resolution is "it's a weird thing I like", good vs bad isn't even the right axis.
* Accepting a label with all its baggage. "i'm not a brony, but I watch MLP", "i'm not a furry but I
understand why some people are", etc.
    * done.


Cut Sections
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why did a random background character with crossed eyes and 0 speaking lines become one of the most
popular characters of the show? It just did. Why does everything have to be horse pun? That's just
the way it is..

Friendship is Magic is not a perfect show. Hoooo boy does it have flaws. But it's a guilty pleasure that's
fun once you get into it.

The show is primarily a slice of life show that's light on continuity. Some members of the Mane 6 (NAMES) get into a situation,
supported by side characters, and hijinks ensue. They all have strengths and flaws, and when written
well, the ponies bounce off each other and are really entertaining or touching. It's not just
stuff like "let's go to the store!", there are real conflicts and resolutions. Especially in the
later seasons, these conflicts can be very relatable to adults. For example, there's an episode
about a pony who started dating a single mom. The mom has a daughter, and she hates him - the episode
is about him trying to find a way to relate to her. That's a more extreme example, but there are
others like that.

Every now and then (usually around the season premiere and finale), the show drops the slice of life,
and turns into a high stakes adventure where the fate of the world is at stake. This tends to be
heavier on continuity, involves a lot more fighting and power of friendship speeches, and basically
turns into a magical girl anime. But you know, with ponies.

> Explanations similar to Dr. Redden’s–basically, some version of the idea that the world is a rough and cynical place and that MLP presents an alternative space, no matter how delimited or constrained, that is more trusting and open–are pretty common within the fandom as part of people’s personal narratives for why and how they became bronies (obviously, this is not true for everyone, but it’s clearly a fandom trope) [...]
> But there are many others who narrate their experience as simply watching a show that they like–just like any other show–and, to their surprise finding outside resistance. Indeed, we don’t expect people to explain their affinity for most elements of popular culture. You need not justify why you watch “Breaking Bad” or “Game of Thrones.”

The above is from [an interview with two ethnographers](https://blogs.loc.gov/thesignal/2014/08/research-is-magic-an-interview-with-ethnographers-jason-nguyen-kurt-baer/) that studied brony culture.
(Ethnographer is the formal term for someone who studies and documents a culture, often while participating in that culture themselves to get an authentic
view of what it's like for insiders - which is why they have pony OCs.)
If you're interested in the origins of the fandom, I think most of their analysis is correct.

The distinction is not whether bronies are weird, because they are. It's not whether they deserve to be
made fun of, because they do. It's about whether they deserve to be the subject of hate, bad-natured
humor, and punch down comedy. Most fandoms are islands of misfit toys. Look closely enough at any of them,
and you'll find some truly messed up things.
