Once upon a time, in the ancient year of 2023, I was at an ML conference. The night was young, the drinks were flowing, and the topic turned to one question: "if you could take any machine learning subfield, and give all their
resources to a different one, what are you killing and what are you saving?"

One person there declared they'd kill robotics. I don't remember what they saved, but when I pushed them on it, they said nothing happens in robotics, relative to everything else.

I have two counterclaims:

* The reason it looks like nothing happens in robotics is because you can't do anything without directly tackling the hard problems.
* The hard problems of robotics are not unique to robotics. They are universal to agents in general, and if you're aiming in that direction, they're coming for you.
